A total of 630 spliceosomal and splicing-related proteins were collected from the Spliceosome DB [42] KEGG [43] and other literature references [1 23] (Additional file 2: Table S1A). This compendium comprises functionally confirmed spliceosomal proteins but also proteins related to other RNA-maturation processes such as mRNA surveillance export capping and polyadenylation. We included the latter proteins because they typically co-purify with the spliceosome [1 23] and are functionally associated or coupled with splicing [7 8 44]. Throughout the manuscript we consider this extended set of proteins as ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚â§spliceosomal proteins‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•. A total of 37231 PPIs formed by these proteins were extracted from HPRD [25] and Hegele et al. [23]. In total 31363 co-expression profiles between mRNAs coding for these proteins and PPI partners were collected from the Human U133A/GNF1H microarray dataset [45] (Additional file 2: Table S1B).,139,2

Figure S2 contains overview of the workflow of TAPIN purification of nuclei and the molecular size distribution of amplified cDNA obtained from the 14 TAPIN-seq libraries. Figure S3 and S4 contains the view of the cell bodies of MB KCs in the confocal images that have double labeling for immunostaining and GAL4 expression. Table S1 contains the TAPIN-seq library statistics including the numbers of raw reads pseudoaligned reads and uniquely aligned reads as well as the detected gene numbers. Table S2 contains the full list of genes enriched and depleted in individual MB classes and subtypes. The sequencing reads and processed data files including the tables of estimated abundances are available in NCBI GEO (GSE119629). All code used to analyze RNA-seq results and create the figures and tables in this manuscript are available in the GitHub repository (http://github.com/fredpdavis/mushroombody).
