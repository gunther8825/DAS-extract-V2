We can consider habituation as a natural adaptation process to environmental stimuli. This is amongst the simplest and most widespread forms of behavioral plasticity. It has been observed from protozoan through mollusks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Wyers et al., 1973</xref>) to mammals, and including humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Deutsch &#x00026; Deutsch, 1973</xref>).</p><p>Decades ago, a set of criteria has been compiled to define differences between sensory adaptation, effector fatigue and genuine habituation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Groves &#x00026; Thompson, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Thompson &#x00026; Spencer, 1966</xref>), but the underlying molecular mechanisms of habituation still are not well understood. The best-studied system to date is the siphon withdrawal reflex in a marine mollusk, <italic>Aplysia californica</italic>. Study of this circuit has shown that monosynaptic depression at presynaptic terminals of mechanoreceptor cells at least are partially responsible for diminishing responses during repeated tactile stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Castellucci et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Pinsker et al., 1970</xref>). This finding is consistent with data from work on crayfish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Krasne, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Zucker, 1972</xref>), <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Wicks &#x00026; Rankin, 1997</xref>), <italic>Aplysia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Rayport &#x00026; Schacher, 1986</xref>) and rat cultured neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">McFadden &#x00026; Koshland, 1990</xref>). This response depression involves a reduced Ca<sup>++</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Edmonds et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Klein et al., 1980</xref>) and decreased presence of synaptic vesicles at active zones of sensory neuron presynaptic terminals, leading to decreased neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bailey &#x00026; Chen, 1988</xref>). Additional studies suggest that monosynaptic depression cannot be the only mechanism to achieve behavior habituation, and other parallel neural mechanisms, such as long-term depression, might be present, as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Peretz et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Stopfer &#x00026; Carew, 1996</xref>).</p><p>Isolating new learning mutants is a potentially effective way to uncover the molecular pathways underlying learning and memory formation. The handful of genetic screens performed so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Aceves-Pina et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Boynton &#x00026; Tully, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Dubnau et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Dura et al., 1993</xref>) employed associative learning assays that are labor intensive and yielded a limited number of mutants. As a possible alternative, we have developed a versatile jump reflex habituation paradigm, suitable for analyzing behavior properties of habituation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, which can be used as an effective screen for mutants affecting simpler forms of behavioral plasticity.</p><p>It is already established that learning mutants isolated in instrumental or classical conditioning paradigms, as <italic>dunce</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Dudai et al., 1976</xref>) amnesiac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Quinn et al., 1979</xref>), <italic>rutabaga</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Aceves-Pina et al., 1983</xref>), and <italic>Su-var</italic>(3)601 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Asztalos et al., 1993</xref>) are affected in nonassociative learning as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Asztalos et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Corfas &#x00026; Dudai, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Duerr &#x00026; Quinn, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Engel &#x00026; Wu, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Rees &#x00026; Spatz, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Vaias et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Wittekind &#x00026; Spatz, 1988</xref>).

The test tubes were inserted into an aluminum base with small holes in it. A vacuum source was connected to the base creating a continuous airflow (1000 ml/min). Odorant was delivered by a computer controlled 3-way solenoid valve which switched the air current from air, which was traveling through mineral oil (control), to air which bubbled through a certain concentration of benzaldehyde (BA) in mineral oil. Each training trial consisted of a four-second odor presentation with varying inter-trial interval (ITI). Response to odorant was monitored as to whether or not the fly jumped during the four-second odor presentation or in the following three seconds and deemed habituated when it failed to jump in four consecutive trials (no-jump criterion). A habituation score was expressed as the number of trials required to reach the no-jump criterion (trials to criterion; TTC).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Apparatus for habituation of the olfactory jump response.

Upon reaching criterion, the chamber containing the fly was vortexed for 75 s, returned to the habituation apparatus, the odor then was presented for four seconds and the fly was scored for a jump response. Thus the dishabituation test occurred two minutes after the last training trial. Dishabituation score (DIS) is the percentage of flies that jumped to the odor test-trial after vortexing. To test for spontaneous recovery (a measure of memory loss), a separate set of flies were left undisturbed during the two-minute period, presented with odor and then subjected to an odor test-trial. Spontaneous recovery score (SR) is the percentage of these flies that jumped to the odor test-trial.</p><p>Experiments were run in an environmentally controlled room at 25C and at 70&#x02013;80% relative humidity.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>JMP 3.1 statistical software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC USA) was used for data analysis.</p><p>As TTCs did not show normal distribution (data not shown), we employed a non-parametric Wilcoxon/Kruskal-Wallis test to compare mutant data with those of wild-type (&#x003b1; = 0.05).</p><p>To obtain Spontaneous Recovery (SR) and Dishabituation (DIS) scores, means of single-day data were calculated.

If we monitor jump response at different times after flies reach the no-jump criterion, the jump response slowly recovers and reaches its original maximum at around 60 min after the last training trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

In these experiments, we applied a strong mechanical stimulus (75 s of vortexing) immediately after the fly achieved its no-jump criterion and then subjected it to an odor test-trial afterwards. For ITIs of 1-min and longer, dishabituation scores are significantly higher than that of spontaneous recovery scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). If sensory or motor fatigue produced the observed jump response decrement during training, then we would not expect subsequent jump responses to the test-trial to be any higher for the dishabituation group (DIS) than for the spontaneous recovery group (SR). Alternatively, if the test-trail jump response is appreciably higher for DIS than for SR, then we can argue against the presence of fatigue and for the occurrence of dishabituation. For ITIs shorter than 1 min, in fact, DIS scores are lower than for longer ITIs and similar to SR scores, suggesting the presence of fatigue at these shorter ITIs. For this reason, we uses ITIs of 1 min or longer for further habituation experiments.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Effect of inter-trial interval on spontaneous recovery and dishabituation.

In case of olfactory adaptation, one expects that with increasing BA concentrations the probability of response declines faster, yielding lower TTC scores for higher odor intensities. The opposite is expected for habituation, where response decrements to higher stimulus intensities take longer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Groves &#x00026; Thompson, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Thompson &#x00026; Spencer, 1966</xref>). We observed the latter in our experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). TTC scores increased with higher BA concentrations and reached a maximum at about 2.5% BA.

Surprisingly, <italic>dunce<sup>1A</sup></italic> mutants displayed TTC scores no different from normal when trained with a 5-min ITI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, Wilcoxon non-parametric test, <italic>p</italic> = 0.5712). As expected, DIS scores for all mutants are higher after training with a 5-min ITI compared to training with a 1-min ITI, and only that for <italic>rut<sup>2080</sup></italic> mutants is significantly lower than the corresponding DIS score for Canton-S flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, t-test, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0354). Together, these observations support the interpretation that fatigue effects in mutants likely reduced their TTC and DIS scores. It remains difficult to explain why <italic>dunce<sup>1A</sup></italic> mutants appear abnormal after training with a 1-min ITI but not a 5-min ITI.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Previous reports have indicated that fruit flies display a jump response to odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">McKenna et al., 1989</xref>) and that this olfactory jump response wanes with repeated odor presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Tully &#x00026; Koss, 1993</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that habituation contributes to this response decrement with behavioral properties similar to other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Groves &#x00026; Thompson, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Thompson &#x00026; Spencer, 1966</xref>). Higher stimulus intensities yield slower response decrement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). An initially high level of jump response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) wanes with repeated odor presentations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The decremented response then recovers spontaneously over time if a fly is left undisturbed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). If decremented flies are exposed to a strong, noxious stimulus (vortexing), dishabituation occurs, and their responses to an odor test-trial are higher than those after spontaneous recovery (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The response decrement is slower with longer ITIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These observations constitute a classic characterization of habituation, a simple form of nonassociative behavior plasticity.</p><p>During a habituation procedure, sensory and motor fatigue also might contribute to the observed response decrement. Traditionally, two behavioral properties have been used to distinguish these phenomena. First is the demonstration of dishabituation. A decremented response recovers immediately after the animal is exposed to a strong stimulus, especially in another sensory modality, but such rapid recovery cannot occur in the presence of fatigue. Evidence for the latter is apparent in our study, when wild-type flies are trained with ITIs shorter than 1 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) or when mutant flies are trained even with a 1-min ITI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Second is the relation between stimulus intensity and response decrement. Increasing (sensory) fatigue, produced by increasing stimulus intensity, would cause a faster response decrement, while the opposite would be expected in the case of habituation. Our experiments confirmed the latter using a 1-min ITI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>The memory mutants <italic>dunce</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Dudai et al., 1976</xref>), which are impaired in cAMP phosphodiesterase, and <italic>rutabaga</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Aceves-Pina et al., 1983</xref>), which are defective in Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Levin et al., 1992</xref>), were isolated in an operant conditioning (associative learning) paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Quinn et al., 1974</xref>) and also have been shown to be defective in a classical conditioning (associative learning) paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Tully &#x00026; Quinn, 1985</xref>). These mutants also have been show to be defective in nonassociative learning. Employing a proboscis-extension reflex paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Duerr &#x00026; Quinn, 1982</xref>) claimed that <italic>dunce</italic> and <italic>rutabaga</italic> habituate more slowly than wild-type flies. In a cleaning reflex preparation, Corfas and Dudai (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Corfas &#x00026; Dudai, 1989</xref>) showed that habituation of <italic>rutabaga</italic> and <italic>dunce</italic> were normal but their memories decayed more quickly than that of wild-type flies. In an electrophysiological assay, Engel and Wu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Engel &#x00026; Wu, 1996</xref>) found a reduced rate of habituation in <italic>rutabaga</italic> mutants, whereas <italic>dunce</italic> mutants showed a moderate increase in habituation rates. Finally, habituation of the landing response was found to be faster than normal in <italic>dunce</italic> and <italic>rutabaga</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Rees &#x00026; Spatz, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Wittekind &#x00026; Spatz, 1988</xref>). These somewhat varied observations likely result from differing contributions of <italic>bona fide</italic> habituation and fatigue among these assays.</p><p>In our habituation paradigm, <italic>rutabaga<sup>2080</sup></italic> (P-element mutant; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Levin et al., 1992</xref>), <italic>dunce<sup>1</sup></italic> (<italic>dnc<sup>1</sup></italic>, hypomorphic EMS mutant; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Duerr &#x00026; Quinn, 1982</xref>) and <italic>dunce<sup>M14</sup></italic> (<italic>dnc<sup>M14</sup></italic>, amorphic EMS mutant; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Mohler &#x00026; Carroll, 1984</xref>) were tested. The mutations were outcrossed to our wild-type genetic background, so their mutant phenotypes likely results from the documented genetic lesions or possibly from very closely linked second-site effects. Olfactory acuity of these mutants was normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, and data not shown), indicating that they can sense and respond normally to benzaldehyde. With the exception of <italic>dnc<sup>1A</sup></italic> trained with a 5-min ITI, habituation generally was slower than normal for the memory mutants. This observation supports a general interpretation that habituation is slower with increasing ITI because of greater memory loss between each trial. Thus, memory decay is greater than normal for these memory mutants at a given ITI (see SR in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>), thereby yielding higher TTC scores which is particulary evident for <italic>rut</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>The abnormally low DIS scores for mutants, which nonetheless diminishes with increasing ITI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>), suggest a greater fatigue component to the mutants' jump responses. Such fatigue would serve to decrease TTC scores; thus, mutant defects in the habituation process might even be greater than observed. Although the existence of these kinds of mutants could be predicted on the basis of results obtained in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Broster &#x00026; Rankin, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Rankin &#x00026; Broster, 1992</xref>), further investigations are needed to clarify these potential component effects on jump response. Nonetheless, our data indicate that the cAMP pathway plays a significant role in a habituation of the olfactory jump response. More generally, this habituation assay may be suitable for a behavioral screen for mutants with defects in this simpler form of behavioral plasticity.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by NIH grants MH066242 and Dart Neuroscience Inc.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="b1"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Aceves-Pi&#x000f1;na</surname><given-names>E.O.</given-names></name><name><surname>Booker</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name><name><surname>Duerr</surname><given-names>J.S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Livingstone</surname><given-names>M.S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Quinn</surname><given-names>W.G.</given-names></name><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>R.F.</given-names></name><name><surname>Sziber</surname><given-names>P.P.</given-names></name><name><surname>Tempel</surname><given-names>B.L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Tully</surname><given-names>T.P.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Learning and memory in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, studied with mutants</article-title><source>Cold Spring Harb.
