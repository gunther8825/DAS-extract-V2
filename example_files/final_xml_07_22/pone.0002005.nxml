To understand the organization and operation of neuronal circuits, it is therefore necessary to be able to visualize the structure and connectivity of different cell types at high resolution and to manipulate the function of specific cell types with precision. Of particular relevance are the GABAergic inhibitory circuits in the neocortex. GABAergic inhibition is crucial in all aspects of neural circuit operation in the cortex and is mediated by diverse interneuron cell types. Because different cell types are highly intermingled and even neighboring neurons differ in their connectivity and function <xref rid="pone.0002005-DeAngelis1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0002005-Ohki1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, such heterogeneity and complexity has been difficult to penetrate by conventional anatomical and physiological techniques. For example, there is increasing evidence that GABAergic synapses are structurally modified by sensory experience and neural activity <xref rid="pone.0002005-Knott1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0002005-Jiao1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, potentially leading to significant reconfiguration of neural circuits. However, there has been no study that examines the structural dynamics of defined classes of cortical inhibitory neurons and synapses in the intact brain. This gap in knowledge is largely due to the heterogeneity of cortical GABAergic cell types and the lack of a high resolution labeling method.</p><p>Genetic strategies can significantly contribute to studying GABAergic circuits and neural circuits in general because they tap into the intrinsic gene regulatory mechanisms that generate and maintain the cellular diversity of the nervous system <xref rid="pone.0002005-Dymecki1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Because different cell types often display distinct gene expression profiles <xref rid="pone.0002005-Arlotta1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0002005-Lein1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, transcriptional promoters provide genetic access to visualize and manipulate different cell types. Gene knockin and transgenesis using bacterial artificial chromosomes (BAC; <xref rid="pone.0002005-Gong1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>) are two useful techniques to introduce exogenous genes into a cell type of interest defined by the expression of an endogenous gene. In particular, Cre/loxP recombination-regulated gene expression is an efficient and powerful approach to systematically label and manipulate defined cell types <xref rid="pone.0002005-Branda1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. This binary gene expression strategy involves the combination of two mouse strains: a &#x0201c;driver&#x0201d; strain expressing Cre-recombinase in specific cell types and/or brain regions, and an &#x0201c;indicator&#x0201d; strain capable of expressing a gene(s) of interest upon Cre/loxP recombination. To date, an increasing number of cell-type restricted driver lines have been generated <xref rid="pone.0002005-Branda1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. However, the current implementation of this strategy suffers three major shortcomings. First, the spatial and temporal expression pattern of any one single gene may not be ideal to manipulate a cell type at a restricted developmental stage and brain region. Second, with only a few exceptions, the expression level of fluorescent markers introduced by either knockin or BAC trangenics are often insufficient to label fine neuronal structures such as neuronal axons and synapses; expression levels from available indicator lines are orders of magnitude lower than what is necessary for high resolution imaging in vivo. Third, mouse genetic engineering, especially when involving multiple strains, is time consuming and costly.</p><p>Viral-mediated gene delivery represents an alternative and powerful strategy to label and manipulate neurons in the mammalian brain. Because of their multi-copy transfection of a single neuron and the use of strong and ubiquitous transcription promoters, viral-mediated delivery can often achieve high-level gene expression and thus bright labeling of fine structures such as neuronal synapses <xref rid="pone.0002005-Lendvai1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0002005-Stettler1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In addition, viral transfection can be targeted to specific brain regions and developmental stages by stereotactic injection <xref rid="pone.0002005-Cetin1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Furthermore, neurotrophic viruses suitable for longitudinal studies have been well characterized and can now be efficiently engineered at low cost <xref rid="pone.0002005-Osten1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. However, a major drawback of viral-mediated gene delivery is the lack of cell-type specificity - currently there is no general strategy to restrict viral-mediated gene expression to defined cell types for a prolonged time period. Here we describe a method that combines Cre-recombinase knockin mice and Cre-activated adeno-associated viral vectors to achieve high-level, stable, and cell-type specific gene expression. This method is simple, highly efficient, and allows chronic live imaging of defined classes of synapses in vivo and light activation of neuronal spiking. With the establishment of increasing number of Cre knockin and transgenic lines (Cre drivers), this method represents a general strategy to systematically visualize and manipulate specific cell types in-vivo.</p><p>Using this method to label a specific class of inhibitory cell, the neocortical parvalbumin (Pv) inhibitory interneuron, we were able to chronically image, for the first time, the fine axonal structures and dynamics of Pv inhibitory axon boutons in vivo. We found that although the majority of putative Pv presynaptic boutons were stable in young adult mice, bouton additions and subtractions on axonal shafts were readily observed at a rate of 10.10&#x00025; and 9.47&#x00025;, respectively, over 7 days. Our results indicate that Pv inhibitory circuits maintain the potential for structural re-wiring in post-adolescent cortex.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cre-activated adeno-associated viral vectors confer cell-type specific and high-level gene expression in the neocortex</title><p>We chose to explore adeno-associated virus (AAV) because it is considered to be non-pathogenic and non-toxic to neurons <xref rid="pone.0002005-Daly1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0002005-Passini1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, and easy to engineer.

These results indicate that the intrinsic physiological properties of interneurons were preserved after AAV transfection. Together, our results suggest that gene delivery by Cre-activated AAV is suitable for long term morphological, physiological, and behavioral studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Functional demonstration that the Cre-activated AAV method is cell-type specific</title><p>We further demonstrated the versatility of the Cre-activated AAV method by expressing channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2; <xref rid="pone.0002005-Boyden1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0002005-Nagel1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>), a rapidly gated light-sensitive cation channel capable of depolarizing neurons to spike threshold in response to brief pulses of blue light.

Transfected neurons were targeted for either cell-attached or whole-cell recording by visualizing mCherry fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002005-g003">Fig. 3a</xref>). Light-driven action potentials (spikes) were reliably evoked in ChR2mCherry&#x0002b; neurons in response to brief exposure to blue light. The number of spikes increased with longer duration light exposure; and prolonged light stimulation evoked a pattern of spiking that is consistent with PV&#x0002b; interneuron &#x0201c;stuttering&#x0201d; pattern of spiking in response to prolonged depolarizing current injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002005-g003">Fig. 3b</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0002005-Dumitriu1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>). Light-evoked instantaneous firing rates reached up to 260 Hz. In response to 25 ms duration light pulses, the average latency to spike was 4.83&#x0002b;/&#x02212;1.13 ms, and ranged from 2.3 to 9.4 ms (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;6). To confirm that the depolarizing effects of light were direct, whole-cell recordings of ChR2mCherry&#x0002b; neurons were made in response to light stimulation that was set to be sub-threshold for spike generation, in the presence and absence of TTX, a blocker of action potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002005-g003">Fig. 3c</xref>). As expected, light-evoked depolarizing current was maintained in the presence of TTX, excluding the possibility that depolarization was di-synaptically driven. The average latency to current on-set before TTX application was 0.73&#x0002b;/&#x02212;0.19, and was not altered in the presence of TTX, 0.77&#x0002b;/&#x02212;0.17 ms (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3).</p><p>Next, whole-cell recordings were made in ChR2mCherry-negative pyramidal cells post-synaptic to transfected neurons, in areas of dense mCherry labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002005-g003">Fig. 3e</xref>). The following assay was used to demonstrate that ChR2mCherry expression was restricted to PV&#x0002b; interneurons: post-synaptic responses were recorded at the reversal potential for AMPA/NMDA-mediated current (0 mV), a holding potential at which inhibitory current is detected and isolated from excitatory current, and then post-synaptic responses were recorded at the reversal potential for GABA-mediated current (&#x02212;55 mV), a holding potential at which excitatory current is detected and isolated from inhibitory current. In response to a 25 ms duration light pulse, inhibitory current was recorded at a holding potential of 0 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002005-g003">Fig. 3e</xref>). Inhibitory responses were detected in a total of 14 neurons, the average response amplitude was 231&#x0002b;/&#x02212;53.5 pA (range: 649.5&#x02013;38.5 pA). The average latency to current on-set was 6.63&#x0002b;/&#x02212;0.55 ms, therefore considering that the average latency to spike in ChR2mCherry&#x0002b; neurons was 4.83 ms, the post-synaptic response latency is consistent with monosynaptic activation of the current. Of the 14 inhibitory-responsive neurons identified, no excitatory post-synaptic current was detected, nor was any excitatory post-synaptic current detected in any of the other neurons recorded (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;7) that were negative for an inhibitory response. To confirm that if present, excitatory current would be detected under these recording conditions, electrical stimulation was used to evoke both inhibitory and excitatory current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002005-g003">Fig. 3d</xref>), furthermore, both inhibitory and excitatory spontaneous synaptic events were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002005-g003">Fig. 3e</xref>, inset).

Cell-type specific transcription promoters represent crucial tools to systematically establish &#x0201c;genetic access&#x0201d; to cell types, in part achieved by the generation of Cre drivers <xref rid="pone.0002005-Branda1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Here we improve this strategy by incorporating viral-mediated gene expression into the Cre/loxP binary system. By combining the strength of Cre drivers and viral-mediated gene transfer, we developed a versatile and cost-effective method to label and manipulate specific classes of neurons in mouse brain. Two important advances were achieved: 1) high-level gene expression suitable for live imaging of synaptic structures of specific cell types in vivo; 2) light activation of specific neuron types via expression of channelrhodopsin. The method is also versatile in terms of labeling efficiency. We demonstrated that labeling efficiencies of &#x0003e;95&#x00025; can be achieved. For applications requiring sparse labeling, efficiency can be reduced by decreasing the volume of virus injected, and by directing imaging studies to the periphery of viral transfection. This is in contrast to transgenic lines, in which efficiency is fixed (ie, compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002005-g001">Fig. 1</xref> with <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002005.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). Furthermore, viral injection allows gene delivery not only to a restricted cell type (defined by the transcriptional promoter used to drive Cre) but also to a particular brain region and developmental stage, an advantage in behavioral studies. Finally, viral production is more cost- and time-efficient compared to mouse genetic engineering. It should be noted though that AAV has a limited packaging capacity of roughly 5 kb of exogenous DNA <xref rid="pone.0002005-Dong1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p><p>Cortical GABA inhibitory interneurons are crucial for all aspects of neural circuit operation. Furthermore, structural axonal remodeling of inhibitory neurons has been identified as a potential cellular mechanism underlying the fine-tuning of cortical circuitry during experience-development and adult learning. For example, both whisker <xref rid="pone.0002005-Jiao1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and visual <xref rid="pone.0002005-Chattopadhyaya1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> deprivation decreases the number of inhibitory synapses contacting pyramidal cells, while whisker stimulation leads to a persistent increase in the number of presynaptic inhibitory boutons targeting pyramidal spines <xref rid="pone.0002005-Knott1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. A recent study suggests that dendritic remodeling may be more prominent in cortical GABAergic interneurons compared to pyramidal neurons <xref rid="pone.0002005-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. However, due to the heterogeneity of GABAergic cell types and the lack of a high resolution labeling method, the structural dynamics of defined classes of inhibitory cortical neurons and synapses has not been studied in the intact brain. By 2-photon imaging of Cre-activated viral gene expression in a specific cell type, we observed, for the first time, in vivo structural dynamics of Pv&#x0002b; basket interneurons. We found that although putative presynaptic boutons from Pv&#x0002b; basket cells are largely stable, they do remodel even in young adults.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>General Applications</title><p>Because the construction of conditional AAV vectors is straightforward and economic, a variety of applications can be readily implemented. First, intense labeling of specific cell types can be used to trace long-range axon projections <xref rid="pone.0002005-Chamberlin1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and also to purify cell types for analysis of gene expression profiles <xref rid="pone.0002005-Sugino1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Furthermore, subcellular-targeted versions such as a synaptophysin-YFP fusion protein, will allow high resolution imaging of defined neuronal structures in vivo. Second, expression of RFP or channelrhodopsin in specific cell types will facilitate cell type identification in physiology and imaging experiments. Two major techniques used to study mammalian neuronal network activity in vivo, tetrode recording of action potentials and bulk-loaded calcium imaging <xref rid="pone.0002005-Stosiek1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, suffer from the inherent problem of cell type heterogeneity - the cell type identity of the recorded or imaged neuron is extremely difficult to determine. This is true even at the most basic level of distinguishing excitatory vs inhibitory neurons. The method we developed in this study may help alleviate this problem. AAV-LSL-RFP can be used to pre-label a specific cell-type in calcium imaging experiments in vivo, so that the calcium dynamics of a known cortical cell-type can be tracked. In addition, AAV-LSL-ChR2 could be used to identify cell types during tetrode recording. This could be achieved by comparing and matching the spike waveform of isolated units to light-evoked spike waveforms of a known, genetically defined cell-type. Third, conditional AAVs expressing channelrhodopsin or halorhodopsin could be used to activate or inhibit specific populations of cells at precise temporal epochs during a behavioral task to test the relevance of the specific cell-type in circuit function. In addition, dominant negative or shRNA constructs could be introduced via a conditional AAV vector to suppress gene function, thereby modulating the activity of specific cell types in specific brain regions in vivo.</p><p>Recognizing the importance of cell-type based approach, the NIH Neuroscience Blueprint Project has funded efforts to systematically generate Cre-expressing mouse lines (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-MH-06-007.html">http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-MH-06-007.html</ext-link>). Cre-activated viral gene expression increases the usefulness and impact of Cre mouse lines, and represents a significant technical advance in studying neural circuit organization and function. In addition to Cre/loxP, Flp/frt is another well-established recombination system in mice <xref rid="pone.0002005-Awatramani1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.

Therefore, the intensity of 25&#x02013;35 cell somata was quantified for each condition, and the average of the 15 most intense cells was reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002005-g001">Figure 1f</xref>. All reported error estimates were calculated as standard error.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>GFP-expressing neurons transfected with AAV.LS<sub>1</sub>L.GFP and mCherry-expressing neurons transfected with AAV.LS<sub>2</sub>L.ChR2mCherry were visualized using the upright microscope described above and cells were patched using a 63&#x000d7; objective (NA 0.95) under near-infrared differential interference contrast optics. A Texas Red filter set (Chroma) was used in the case of mCherry. Whole-cell current-clamp recordings were made from slices submerged in ACSF (in mM): 126 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 1 MgSO4, 2 CaCl2, 10 D(&#x0002b;)- glucose, and 25 NaCHO3; continuously bubbled with 95&#x00025;O2/5&#x00025;CO2, perfused at a rate of 2&#x02013;3 ml/min (26&#x000b0;C). Unless noted, pipettes were filled with intracellular solution (in mM): 135 K-gluconate, 4.3 KCl, 2 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 0.5 EGTA, 4 MgATP, 20 phosphocreatine(Na), and 0.3 NaGTP, pH 7.3, 300 mOsm having a resistance of 2&#x02013;4 M&#x003a9;. Data were acquired at 5&#x02013;10 kHz and low-pass filtered at 2 kHz. Electrophysiological signals were processed and controlled by a Multiclamp 700A amplifier, Digidata 1322 analog-to-digital converter, and Clampex9 software (Molecular Devices). All reported error estimates were calculated as standard error.</p><p>Light stimulation was delivered using full-field epi-fluorescence through the narrow band GFP filter set. The timing of the light stimulus was controlled via a shutter (model VS25, UniBlitz) and triggered using Clampex9 software. The duration of light delivery was calibrated using a light meter and reported as the duration between the onset and offset of &#x0003e;80&#x00025; maximum light intensity. For post-synaptic recording, pipettes were filled with (in mM): 120 Cs-gluconate, 8 KCl, 10 HEPES, 10 EGTA, 10 QX-314. The reversal potential of GABA-mediated chloride current for this internal solution was empirically measured in response to electrical field stimulation in the presence of 20 &#x000b5;M CNQX and 100 &#x000b5;M APV.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>In vivo 2-photon imaging</title><p>Chronic windows were made following the protocol described in Holtmaat (2004) <xref rid="pone.0002005-Holtmaat1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, 2&#x02013;3 weeks after the injection of AAV-LS<sub>1</sub>L-GFP. Animals were anesthetized with a ketamine/xylazine mixture (0.13 mg/g, 0.10 mg/g body weight) and given a small does of dexamethasone (0.02 ml at 4mg/ml) to reduce inflammation. The skin over the skull was removed and lidocaine was topically applied. An area of skull (approximately 1 mm in diameter) just posterior to the previous viral injection was removed using a dental drill (Henry Schein), leaving the dura intact. A glass coverslip (EM Sciences, #1, 5 mm round) was then coated with slightly warmed agarose (Type III-A, 1&#x00025; in HEPES buffered ACSF), gently placed over the craniotomy, and sealed with dental acrylic.</p><p>On the day of imaging, mice were anesthetized with a ketamine/xylazine mixture (0.13 mg/g, 0.10 mg/g body weight) and mounted in a fixed position below the microscope objective. In-vivo images of GFP-labeled cells were acquired with a custom made 2-photon laser scanning microscope <xref rid="pone.0002005-Lendvai1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, controlled by ScanImage software <xref rid="pone.0002005-Pologruto1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. The light source was a Ti:Sapphire laser (Mira 900, Coherent) running at &#x003bb; 910 nm, powered by a 10-watt pump laser (Verdi V-10, Coherent). Light was focused with scan lens and an objective (40&#x000d7; water-immersion objective, NA 0.8) from Zeiss. Signal was detected with a photomultiplier tube (Hamamatsu). Image stacks were collected in 1micron steps, at a resolution of 0.36&#x02013;0.075 microns per pixel.</p><p>Axon boutons were counted with the aid of ImageJ and Matlab software. Raw images were median filtered (2.0 pixels) prior to quantification. Axons were traced by hand in ImageJ and intensity profile plots (1-pixel thickness) were imported into MatLab. The approximate derivative of the intensity profile plot and the standard deviation of the derivative was calculated for each axon segment, and the presence of a bouton was scored if the derivative value was greater than the positive standard deviation for at least 3 consecutive points, and crossed the negative standard deviation without fluctuating across the zero line.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0002005.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>STOP2 confers conditional expression.
