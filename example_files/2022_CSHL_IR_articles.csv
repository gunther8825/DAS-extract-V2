However, cell-type identification of scATAC-seq data is known to be challenging due to the heterogeneity derived from different protocols and the high dropout rate. RESULTS: In this study, we perform a systematic comparison of seven scATAC-seq datasets of mouse brain to benchmark the efficacy of neuronal cell-type annotation from gene sets. We find that redundant marker genes give a dramatic improvement for a sparse scATAC-seq annotation across the data collected from different studies. Interestingly, simple aggregation of such marker genes achieves performance comparable or higher than that of machine-learning classifiers, suggesting its potential for downstream applications. Based on our results, we reannotated all scATAC-seq data for detailed cell types using robust marker genes. Their meta scATAC-seq profiles are publicly available at https://gillisweb.cshl.edu/Meta_scATAC. Furthermore, we trained a deep neural network to predict chromatin accessibility from only DNA sequence and identified key motifs enriched for each neuronal subtype. Those predicted profiles are visualized together in our database as a valuable resource to explore cell-type specific epigenetic regulation in a sequence-dependent and -independent manner."				40777	7	archive	39	disk0/00/04/07/77	3/31/23 20:07	3/31/23 20:07	3/31/23 20:07	article	show	39	Metabolism in acute myeloid leukemia: mechanistic insights and therapeutic targets	pub	12/22/22	published	10.1182/blood.2022018092	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36548959	36548959	none	Blood		TRUE	Jun-71	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40777	"Metabolic rewiring and cellular reprogramming are trademarks of neoplastic initiation and progression in acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

However, p53 remains unmutated in the majority of cases of glioblastoma (GBM)-the most common and deadly adult brain malignancy1,2. Thus, how p53-mediated tumour suppression is countered in TP53 wild-type (TP53WT) GBM is unknown. Here we describe a GBM-specific epigenetic mechanism in which the chromatin regulator bromodomain-containing protein 8 (BRD8) maintains H2AZ occupancy at p53 target loci through the EP400 histone acetyltransferase complex. This mechanism causes a repressive chromatin state that prevents transactivation by p53 and sustains proliferation. Notably, targeting the bromodomain of BRD8 displaces H2AZ, enhances chromatin accessibility and engages p53 transactivation. This in turn enforces cell cycle arrest and tumour suppression in TP53WT GBM. In line with these findings, BRD8 is highly expressed with H2AZ in proliferating single cells of patient-derived GBM, and is inversely correlated with CDKN1A, a canonical p53 target that encodes p21 (refs. 3,4). This work identifies BRD8 as a selective epigenetic vulnerability for a malignancy for which treatment has not improved for decades. Moreover, targeting the bromodomain of BRD8 may be a promising therapeutic strategy for patients with TP53WT GBM."				40801	6	archive	39	disk0/00/04/08/01	1/23/23 21:02	1/23/23 21:02	1/23/23 21:02	article	show	39	Single Oligonucleotide Capture of RNA And Temperature Elution Series ( SOCRATES ) for Identification of RNA-binding Proteins	pub	12/20/22	published	10.21769/BioProtoc.4572	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36618090	36618090	none	Bio-protocol	e4572	TRUE	2331-8325	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40801	"The importance of studying the mechanistic aspects of long non-coding RNAs is being increasingly emphasized as more and more regulatory RNAs are being discovered.

Cell cycle regulated, genome-wide binding of Rad53 to chromatin was examined. Under replication stress, the kinase bound to sites of active DNA replication initiation and fork progression, but unexpectedly to the promoters of about 20% of genes encoding proteins involved in multiple cellular functions. Rad53 promoter binding correlated with changes in expression of a subset of genes. Rad53 promoter binding to certain genes was influenced by sequence-specific transcription factors and less by checkpoint signaling.

Here we examined the feasibility and accuracy of computational inference of genetic ancestry relying exclusively on cancer-derived data. A data synthesis framework was developed to optimize and assess the performance of the ancestry inference for any given input cancer-derived molecular profile. In its core procedure, the ancestral background of the profiled patient is replaced with one of any number of individuals with known ancestry. The data synthesis framework is applicable to multiple profiling platforms, making it possible to assess the performance of inference specifically for a given molecular profile and separately for each continental-level ancestry; this ability extends to all ancestries, including those without statistically sufficient representation in the existing cancer data. The inference procedure was demonstrated to be accurate and robust in a wide range of sequencing depths. Testing of the approach in four representative cancer types and across three molecular profiling modalities showed that continental-level ancestry of patients can be inferred with high accuracy, as quantified by its agreement with the gold standard of deriving ancestry from matching cancer-free molecular data. This study demonstrates that vast amounts of existing cancer-derived molecular data are potentially amenable to ancestry-oriented studies of the disease without requiring matching cancer-free genomes or patient self-reported ancestry."				40782	7	archive	39	disk0/00/04/07/82	1/6/23 16:59	1/6/23 16:59	1/6/23 16:59	article	show	39	A dopaminergic reward prediction error signal shapes maternal behavior in mice	pub	12/13/22	published	10.1016/j.neuron.2022.11.019	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36543170	36543170	none	Neuron	S0896-6273(22)01073	TRUE	0896-6273	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40782	"How social contact is perceived as rewarding and subsequently modifies interactions is unclear.

Here, we tracked the emergence of a repetitive stereotyped parental retrieval behavior and conclude that VTA DA neurons incrementally refine it by reinforcement learning (RL). Trial-by-trial performance was correlated with the history of DA neuron activity, but DA signals were inconsistent with VTA directly influencing the current trial. We manipulated the subject's expectation of imminent pup contact and show that DA signals convey reward prediction error, a fundamental component of RL. Finally, closed-loop optogenetic inactivation of DA neurons at the onset of pup contact dramatically slowed emergence of parental care.

Such a molecular nexopathy framework posits that the distinct characteristics of neurodegenerative disorders stem from interactions between the network and surrounding molecular players. However, the effects of these modulators remain unquantified. Here, we present Nexopathy in silico (""Nexis""), a quantitative model of tau progression augmenting earlier models by including parameters of pathology propagation defined by the molecular modulators of connectome-based spread. Our Nexis:microglia model provides the first quantitative characterization of this effect on the whole brain by expanding previous models of neuropathology progression by incorporating microglial influence. We show that Trem2, but not microglial homeostasis genes, significantly improved the model's predictive power. Trem2 appears to reduce tau accumulation rate while increasing its interregional spread from the hippocampal seed area, causing higher tau burden in the striatum, pallidum, and contralateral hippocampus.

Most currently used approaches utilize either bulk whole genome sequencing or single-cell DNA sequencing and are based on calling copy number alterations and single nucleotide variants (SNVs). Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is commonly applied to explore differential gene expression of cancer cells throughout tumor progression. The method exacerbates the single-cell sequencing problem of low yield per cell with uneven expression levels. This accounts for low and uneven sequencing coverage and makes SNV detection and phylogenetic analysis challenging. In this article, we demonstrate for the first time that scRNA-seq data contain sufficient evolutionary signal and can also be utilized in phylogenetic analyses. We explore and compare results of such analyses based on both expression levels and SNVs called from scRNA-seq data. Both techniques are shown to be useful for reconstructing phylogenetic relationships between cells, reflecting the clonal composition of a tumor. Both standardized expression values and SNVs appear to be equally capable of reconstructing a similar pattern of phylogenetic relationship. This pattern is stable even when phylogenetic uncertainty is taken in account. Our results open up a new direction of somatic phylogenetics based on scRNA-seq data.

Resistance to anoikis, a form of cell death initiated by cell detachment from the surrounding extracellular matrix, is one of the cellular processes critical for PCa progression towards aggressive disease. Therefore, further understanding of anoikis regulation in PCa might provide therapeutic opportunities. Here, we discover that PCa tumors with concomitant inhibition of two tumor suppressor phosphatases, PP2A and PTEN, are particularly aggressive, having less than 50% 5-year secondary-therapy-free patient survival. Functionally, overexpression of PME-1, a methylesterase for the catalytic PP2A-C subunit, inhibits anoikis in PTEN-deficient PCa cells. In vivo, PME-1 inhibition increased apoptosis in in ovo PCa tumor xenografts, and attenuated PCa cell survival in zebrafish circulation. Molecularly, PME-1-deficient PC3 cells display increased trimethylation at lysines 9 and 27 of histone H3 (H3K9me3 and H3K27me3), a phenotype known to correlate with increased apoptosis sensitivity. In summary, our results demonstrate that PME-1 supports anoikis resistance in PTEN-deficient PCa cells. Clinically, these results identify PME-1 as a candidate biomarker for a subset of particularly aggressive PTEN-deficient PCa."				40765	6	archive	39	disk0/00/04/07/65	12/5/22 17:25	12/5/22 17:25	12/5/22 17:25	article	show	39	Non-symmetric pinning of topological defects in living liquid crystals	pub	12/1/22	published	10.1038/s42005-022-01077-w			public	Communications Physics		TRUE	2399-3650	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40765	"Topological defects, such as vortices and disclinations, play a crucial role in spatiotemporal organization of equilibrium and non-equilibrium systems.

Two conceptually different types of implementations were used: (a) guided by physical intuition (such as the local dependence of the derivatives) and (b) in the absence of any physical assumptions (black-box model).

Previously, we identified a cortical neuron type, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons, in auditory cortex that is recruited by behavioral reinforcers and mediates disinhibitory control by inhibiting other inhibitory neurons. As the same disinhibitory cortical circuit is present virtually throughout cortex, we wondered whether VIP neurons are likewise recruited by reinforcers throughout cortex. We monitored VIP neural activity in dozens of cortical regions using three-dimensional random access two-photon microscopy and fiber photometry while mice learned an auditory discrimination task. We found that reward and punishment during initial learning produce rapid, cortex-wide activation of most VIP interneurons. This global recruitment mode showed variations in temporal dynamics in individual neurons and across areas. Neither the weak sensory tuning of VIP interneurons in visual cortex nor their arousal state modulation was fully predictive of reinforcer responses. We suggest that the global response mode of cortical VIP interneurons supports a cell-type-specific circuit mechanism by which organism-level information about reinforcers regulates local circuit processing and plasticity."	11		PMC9683790	40770	8	archive	39	disk0/00/04/07/70	12/12/22 17:05	12/12/22 17:05	12/12/22 17:05	article	show	39	Clinical applications of 3D normal and breast cancer organoids: A review of concepts and methods	pub	11/19/22	published	10.1177/15353702221131877	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36408534	36408534	none	Experimental Biology and Medicine	1.54E+16	TRUE	1535-3702	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40770	"While mouse models and two-dimensional (2D) cell culture systems have dominated as research tools for cancer biology, three-dimensional (3D) cultures have gained traction as a new approach that retains features of in vivo biology within an in vitro system.

An RBPMS T113/118 phosphomimetic T/E mutant showed decreased splicing regulatory activity both in transfected cells and in a cell-free in vitro assay, while a non-phosphorylatable T/A mutant retained full activity. Loss of splicing activity was associated with a modest reduction in RNA affinity but significantly reduced RNA binding in nuclear extract. A lower degree of oligomerization of the T/E mutant might cause lower avidity of multivalent RNA binding. However, NMR analysis also revealed that the T113/118E peptide acts as an RNA mimic which can loop back and antagonize RNA-binding by the RRM domain. Finally, we identified ERK2 as the most likely kinase responsible for phosphorylation at Thr113 and Thr118. Collectively, our data identify a potential mechanism for rapid modulation of the SMC splicing program in response to external signals during the vascular injury response and atherogenesis."	50	20	PMC9723635	40755	13	archive	39	disk0/00/04/07/55	11/14/22 17:26	11/14/22 17:26	11/14/22 17:26	article	show	39	Recent Advances at the Interface of Neuroscience and Artificial Neural Networks	pub	11/9/22	published	10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1503-22.2022	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36351830	36351830	restricted	The Journal of Neuroscience	8514-8523	TRUE	1529-2401	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40755	"Biological neural networks adapt and learn in diverse behavioral contexts.

Spindle assembly, chromosome alignment and segregation require highly dynamic MTs. The plus ends of MTs have been extensively investigated; instead, their minus end structure remains poorly characterized. Here, we used large-scale electron tomography to study the morphology of the MT minus ends in 3D-reconstructed metaphase spindles in HeLa cells. In contrast to the homogeneous open morphology of the MT plus ends at the kinetochores, we found that MT minus ends are heterogeneous showing either open or closed morphologies. Silencing the minus-end specific stabilizer, MCRS1 increased the proportion of open MT minus ends. Altogether, these data suggest a correlation between the morphology and the dynamic state of the MT ends. Taking this heterogeneity of the MT minus end morphologies into account, our work indicates an unsynchronized behavior of MTs at the spindle poles, thus laying the ground for further studies on the complexity of MT dynamics regulation.

Chromosome conformation capture (3C)-based methods such as Hi-C have been extensively used to obtain chromatin contacts. However, since the sparsity of these maps increases with an increase in genomic distance between contacts, long-range or trans-chromatin contacts are especially challenging to sample. RESULTS: Here, we create a high-density reference genome-wide chromatin contact map using a meta-analytic approach. We integrate 3600 human, 6700 mouse, and 500 fly Hi-C experiments to create species-specific meta-Hi-C chromatin contact maps with 304 billion, 193 billion, and 19 billion contacts in respective species. We validate that meta-Hi-C contact maps are uniquely powered to capture functional chromatin contacts in both cis and trans. We find that while individual dataset Hi-C networks are largely unable to predict any long-range coexpression (median 0.54 AUC), meta-Hi-C networks perform comparably in both cis and trans (0.65 AUC vs 0.64 AUC). Similarly, for long-range expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), meta-Hi-C contacts outperform all individual Hi-C experiments, providing an improvement over the conventionally used linear genomic distance-based association. Assessing between species, we find patterns of chromatin contact conservation in both cis and trans and strong associations with coexpression even in species for which Hi-C data is lacking. CONCLUSIONS: We have generated an integrated chromatin interaction network which complements a large number of methodological and analytic approaches focused on improved specificity or interpretation. This high-depth ""super-experiment"" is surprisingly powerful in capturing long-range functional relationships of chromatin interactions, which are now able to predict coexpression, eQTLs, and cross-species relationships.

Here, we demonstrate that perturbation of an embryonic stem cell/early embryonic lncRNA, pluripotency-associated transcript 4 (Platr4), directly influences the specification of cardiac-mesoderm-lineage differentiation. We show that Platr4 acts as a molecular scaffold or chaperone interacting with the Hippo-signaling pathway molecules Yap and Tead4 to regulate the expression of a downstream target gene, Ctgf, which is crucial to the cardiac-lineage program. Importantly, Platr4 knockout mice exhibit myocardial atrophy and valve mucinous degeneration, which are both associated with reduced cardiac output and sudden heart failure.

Type I and II interferons (IFNs) stimulate the KYN/TRP pathway, producing elevated QA/kynurenic acid (KA), a potential neurotoxic imbalance that may contribute to SLE-mediated cognitive dysfunction. We determined whether peripheral blood interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression associates with elevated serum KYN:TRP and QA:KA ratios in SLE. METHODS: ISG expression (whole-blood RNA sequencing) and serum metabolite ratios (high-performance liquid chromatography) were measured in 72 subjects with SLE and 73 healthy controls (HCs). ISG were identified from published gene sets and individual IFN scores were derived to analyse associations with metabolite ratios, clinical parameters and neuropsychological assessments. SLE analyses were grouped by level of ISG expression ('IFN high', 'IFN low' and 'IFN similar to HC') and level of monocyte-associated gene expression (using CIBERSORTx). RESULTS: Serum KYN:TRP and QA:KA ratios were higher in SLE than in HC (p<0.01). 933 genes were differentially expressed ≥2-fold in SLE versus HC (p<0.05). 70 of the top 100 most highly variant genes were ISG. Approximately half of overexpressed genes that correlated with KYN:TRP and QA:KA ratios (p<0.05) were ISG. In 36 IFN-high subjects with SLE, IFN scores correlated with KYN:TRP ratios (p<0.01), but not with QA:KA ratios. Of these 36 subjects, 23 had high monocyte-associated gene expression, and in this subgroup, the IFN scores correlated with both KY:NTRP and QA:KA ratios (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: High ISG expression correlated with elevated KYN:TRP ratios in subjects with SLE, suggesting IFN-mediated KYN/TRP pathway activation, and with QA:KA ratios in a subset with high monocyte-associated gene expression, suggesting that KYN/TRP pathway activation may be particularly important in monocytes. These results need validation, which may aid in determining which patient subset may benefit from therapeutics directed at the IFN or KYN/TRP pathways to ameliorate a potentially neurotoxic QA/KA imbalance."	9	1		40751	14	archive	39	disk0/00/04/07/51	11/9/22 14:55	11/9/22 14:55	11/9/22 14:55	article	show	39	Selective sweeps on different pigmentation genes mediate convergent evolution of island melanism in two incipient bird species	pub	11/1/22	published	10.1371/journal.pgen.1010474	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36318577	36318577	public	Plos Genetics	e1010474	TRUE	1553-7390	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40751	"Insular organisms often evolve predictable phenotypes, like flightlessness, extreme body sizes, or increased melanin deposition. The evolutionary forces and molecular targets mediating these patterns remain mostly unknown. Here we study the Chestnut-bellied Monarch (Monarcha castaneiventris) from the Solomon Islands, a complex of closely related subspecies in the early stages of speciation. On the large island of Makira M. c. megarhynchus has a chestnut belly, whereas on the small satellite islands of Ugi, and Santa Ana and Santa Catalina (SA/SC) M. c. ugiensis is entirely iridescent blue-black (i.e., melanic). Melanism has likely evolved twice, as the Ugi and SA/SC populations were established independently. To investigate the genetic basis of melanism on each island we generated whole genome sequence data from all three populations. Non-synonymous mutations at the MC1R pigmentation gene are associated with melanism on SA/SC, while ASIP, an antagonistic ligand of MC1R, is associated with melanism on Ugi. Both genes show evidence of selective sweeps in traditional summary statistics and statistics derived from the ancestral recombination graph (ARG). Using the ARG in combination with machine learning, we inferred selection strength, timing of onset and allele frequency trajectories. MC1R shows evidence of a recent, strong, soft selective sweep. The region including ASIP shows more complex signatures; however, we find evidence for sweeps in mutations near ASIP, which are comparatively older than those on MC1R and have been under relatively strong selection. Overall, our study shows convergent melanism results from selective sweeps at independent molecular targets, evolving in taxa where coloration likely mediates reproductive isolation with the neighboring chestnut-bellied subspecies."	18	11		40752	16	archive	39	disk0/00/04/07/52	11/9/22 15:19	11/9/22 15:19	11/9/22 15:19	article	show	39	BRCA mutational status shapes the stromal microenvironment of pancreatic cancer linking clusterin expression in cancer associated fibroblasts with HSF1 signaling	pub	10/31/22	published	10.1038/s41467-022-34081-3	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36316305	36316305	public	Nature Communications	6513	TRUE	2041-1723	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40752	"Tumors initiate by mutations in cancer cells, and progress through interactions of the cancer cells with non-malignant cells of the tumor microenvironment.

Here we address this question by dissecting the stromal landscape of BRCA-mutated and BRCA Wild-type pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. We comprehensively analyze pancreatic cancer samples from 42 patients, revealing different CAF subtype compositions in germline BRCA-mutated vs. BRCA Wild-type tumors. In particular, we detect an increase in a subset of immune-regulatory clusterin-positive CAFs in BRCA-mutated tumors.

SMARCA4 co-localizes with SOX10 at gene regulatory elements (GRE) to control the expression of genes involved in cell growth and extracellular matrix (ECM). Moreover, SMARCA4 chromatin binding is reduced upon depletion of SOX10 or H3.3K27M, a mutation occurring in about 60% DMG tumors. Furthermore, the SMARCA4 occupancy at enhancers marked by both SOX10 and H3K27 acetylation is reduced the most upon depleting the H3.3K27M mutation.

Surprisingly, we observed D-serine binding to both GluN1 and GluN2A LBDs, suggesting that D-serine competes with glutamate for binding to GluN2A. This mechanism is confirmed by our electrophysiology experiments, which show that D-serine is indeed inhibitory at high concentrations. Although free energy calculations indicate that D-serine stabilizes the closed GluN2A LBD, its inhibitory behavior suggests that it either does not remain bound long enough or does not generate sufficient force for ion channel gating.

Experiments provide imperfect ""ground truth"" information about a small subset of potential interactions in a specific biological context, which can then be extended to the whole genome across different contexts, such as conditions, tissues, or species, through machine learning methods. However, evaluating the performance of these methods remains a critical challenge. Here, we propose to evaluate the generalizability of gene characterizations through the shape of performance curves. RESULTS: We identify Functional Equivalence Classes (FECs), subsets of annotated and unannotated genes that jointly drive performance, by assessing the presence of straight lines in ROC curves built from gene-centric prediction tasks, such as function or interaction predictions. FECs are widespread across data types and methods, they can be used to evaluate the extent and context-specificity of functional annotations in a data-driven manner. For example, FECs suggest that B cell markers can be decomposed into shared primary markers (10 to 50 genes), and tissue-specific secondary markers (100 to 500 genes). In addition, FECs suggest the existence of functional modules that span a wide range of the genome, with marker sets spanning at most 5% of the genome and data-driven extensions of Gene Ontology sets spanning up to 40% of the genome. Simple to assess visually and statistically, the identification of FECs in performance curves paves the way for novel functional characterization and increased robustness in the definition of functional gene sets.

We first rapidly identified a natural structural variant in a bHLH gene that causes petal color variation. Further, and against expectations, we found that CRISPR-Cas9 targeted mutagenesis of 11 MADS-box genes, including purported essential regulators of ICS, had no effect on inflation. In a forward genetics screen, we identified huskless, which lacks ICS due to mutation of an AP2-like gene that causes sepals and petals to merge into a single whorl of mixed identity. These resources and findings elevate Physalis to a new Solanaceae model system, and establish a paradigm in the search for factors driving ICS."	35	1	PMC9806562	40745	4	archive	39	disk0/00/04/07/45	11/7/22 20:58	11/7/22 20:58	11/7/22 20:58	article	show	39	"Structural insights into assembly and function of GluN1-2C, GluN1-2A-2C, and GluN1-2D NMDARs"	pub	10/20/22	published	10.1016/j.molcel.2022.10.008	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36309015	36309015	none	Molecular Cell	S1097-2765(22)00965	TRUE	1097-2765	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40745	"Neurotransmission mediated by diverse subtypes of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) is fundamental for basic brain functions and development as well as neuropsychiatric diseases and disorders.

Here, we show that neurotensin-expressing neurons in the mouse interstitial nucleus of the posterior limb of the anterior commissure (IPAC), a nucleus of the central extended amygdala, encode dietary preference for unhealthy energy-dense foods. Optogenetic activation of IPACNts neurons promotes obesogenic behaviors, such as hedonic eating, and modulates food preference. Conversely, acute inhibition of IPACNts neurons reduces feeding and decreases hedonic eating. Chronic inactivation of IPACNts neurons recapitulates these effects, reduces preference for sweet, non-caloric tastants and, furthermore, enhances locomotion and energy expenditure; as a result, mice display long-term weight loss and improved metabolic health and are protected from obesity. Thus, the activity of a single neuronal population bidirectionally regulates energy homeostasis.

Genetic diversity within populations is largely structured by reproduction, with the prevalence of asexual versus sexual reproduction often underpinning important diversity metrics that determine selection efficacy. Asexual or clonal reproduction is expected to reduce genotypic diversity and slow down adaptation through reduced selection efficacy, yet the evolutionary consequences of clonal reproduction remain unclear for many natural populations. Here, we examine the genomic consequences of sympatric sexual (haplodiplontic) and clonal morphs of the kelp Ecklonia radiata that occur interspersed on reefs in Hamelin Bay, Western Australia. Using genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms, we confirm significant asexual reproduction for the clonal populations, indicated by a significantly lower number of multi-locus lineages and higher intra-individual diversity patterns (individual multi-locus heterozygosity, MLH). Nevertheless, co-ancestry analysis and breeding experiments confirmed that sexual reproduction by the clonal morph and interbreeding between the two morphs is still possible, but varies among populations. One clonal population with long-term asexuality showed trends of decreased selection efficacy (increased ratio non- vs. synonymous gene diversities). Yet, all clonal populations showed distinct patterns of putative local adaptation relative to the sexual morph, possibly indicating maladaptation to local environmental conditions and high vulnerability of this unique clonal morph to environmental stress."	9			40735	6	archive	39	disk0/00/04/07/35	10/20/22 2:03	10/20/22 2:39	10/20/22 2:03	article	show	39	A-MYB/TCFL5 regulatory architecture ensures the production of pachytene piRNAs in placental mammals	pub	10/14/22	published	10.1261/rna.079472.122	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36241367	36241367	public	RNA	rna.079472.122-rna.079472.122	TRUE	1355-8382	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40735	"In male mice, the transcription factor A MYB initiates the transcription of pachytene piRNA genes during meiosis.

Subsequently, A MYB and TCFL5 reciprocally reinforce their own transcription to establish a positive feedback circuit that triggers pachytene piRNA production. TCFL5 regulates the expression of genes required for piRNA maturation and promotes transcription of evolutionarily young pachytene piRNA genes, whereas A-MYB activates the transcription of older pachytene piRNA genes. Intriguingly, pachytene piRNAs from TCFL5-dependent young loci initiates the production of piRNAs from A-MYB-dependent older loci ensuring the self-propagation of pachytene piRNAs.

To better understand the diversity of the brainstem branching patterns of these pyramidal tract projections, we used MAPseq, a molecular barcode technique for population-scale sampling with single-axon resolution. In experiments using mice of both sexes, we first confirmed prior results demonstrating the basic efficacy of axonal barcode identification of primary motor cortex (M1) PT-type axons, including corticobulbar (CBULB) and corticospinal (CSPI) subclasses. We then used multiplexed MAPseq to analyze projections from M1 and M2 (caudal and rostral forelimb areas). The four basic axon subclasses comprising these projections (M1-CSPI, M1-CBULB, M2-CSPI, M2-CBULB) showed a complex mix of differences and similarities in their brainstem projection profiles. This included relatively abundant branching by all classes in the dorsal midbrain, by M2 subclasses in the pons, and by CSPI subclasses in the dorsal medulla. Cluster analysis showed graded distributions of the basic subclasses within the PT class. Clusters were of diversely mixed subclass composition and showed distinct rostrocaudal and/or dorsomedial projection biases. Exemplifying these patterns was a subcluster likely enriched in corticocuneate branches. Overall, the results indicate high yet systematic PT axon diversity at the level of brainstem branching patterns; projections of M1 and M2 appear qualitatively similar, yet with quantitative differences in subclasses and clusters.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Axons of the PT class of cortical projection neurons, which includes corticospinal and corticobulbar neurons, anatomically link motor cortex to brainstem and spinal cord circuits. Both of these subclasses can form branches to brainstem destinations along the way, but the extent and diversity of these branching patterns is incompletely understood. Here, we used MAPseq to tag PT axons with individual molecular barcodes for high-throughput quantification of branching patterns across the brainstem. The results reveal diverse, complex, yet systematic branching patterns of corticospinal and corticobulbar neurons arising from two motor cortex areas, M1 and M2."	42	41	PMC9581560	40738	16	archive	39	disk0/00/04/07/38	10/20/22 2:28	10/20/22 2:37	10/20/22 2:28	article	show	39	Allele-specific differential regulation of monoallelically expressed autosomal genes in the cardiac lineage	pub	10/10/22	published	10.1038/s41467-022-33722-x	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36216821	36216821	public	Nature Communications	5984	TRUE	2041-1723	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40738	"Each mammalian autosomal gene is represented by two alleles in diploid cells.

However, modeling and understanding these higher-order interactions remains challenging.

The main idea is to make predictions for unobserved genotypes that match the type and extent of epistasis found in the observed data. This information on the type and extent of epistasis can be extracted by considering how phenotypic correlations change as a function of mutational distance, which is equivalent to estimating the fraction of phenotypic variance due to each order of genetic interaction (additive, pairwise, three-way, etc.). Using these estimated variance components, we then define an empirical Bayes prior that in expectation matches the observed pattern of epistasis and reconstruct the genotype-phenotype mapping by conducting Gaussian process regression under this prior.

We find that tufted cells substantially outperform mitral cells in decoding both odor identity and intensity. Cortical feedback selectively regulates the activity of its dominant bulb projection cell type and implements different computations. Piriform feedback specifically restructures mitral responses, whereas feedback from the anterior olfactory nucleus preferentially controls the gain of tufted representations without altering their odor tuning. Our results identify distinct functional loops involving the mitral and tufted cells and their cortical targets. We suggest that in addition to the canonical mitral-to-piriform pathway, tufted cells and their target regions are ideally positioned to compute odor identity."				40731	6	archive	39	disk0/00/04/07/31	10/7/22 0:46	10/7/22 0:46	10/7/22 0:46	article	show	39	At home and away: A mobile transcription factor regulates meristem development in discrete spatial domains	pub	9/26/22	published	10.1093/plphys/kiac453	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36161497	36161497	public	Plant Physiology	kiac453	TRUE	0032-0889	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40731					40734	6	archive	39	disk0/00/04/07/34	10/14/22 1:04	10/14/22 1:04	10/14/22 1:04	article	show	39	Rare copy number variation in posttraumatic stress disorder	pub	9/21/22	published	10.1038/s41380-022-01776-4	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36131047	36131047	public	Molecular Psychiatry		TRUE	1359-4184	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40734	"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a heritable (h2 = 24-71%) psychiatric illness.

We present an association study of CNV burden and PTSD symptoms in a sample of 114,383 participants (13,036 cases and 101,347 controls) of European ancestry. CNVs were called using two calling algorithms and intersected to a consensus set. Quality control was performed to remove strong outlier samples. CNVs were examined for association with PTSD within each cohort using linear or logistic regression analysis adjusted for population structure and CNV quality metrics, then inverse variance weighted meta-analyzed across cohorts. We examined the genome-wide total span of CNVs, enrichment of CNVs within specified gene-sets, and CNVs overlapping individual genes and implicated neurodevelopmental regions. The total distance covered by deletions crossing over known neurodevelopmental CNV regions was significant (beta = 0.029, SE = 0.005, P = 6.3 × 10-8). The genome-wide neurodevelopmental CNV burden identified explains 0.034% of the variation in PTSD symptoms. The 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 microdeletion region was significantly associated with PTSD (beta = 0.0206, SE = 0.0056, P = 0.0002). No individual significant genes interrupted by CNV were identified. 22 gene pathways related to the function of the nervous system and brain were significant in pathway analysis (FDR q < 0.05), but these associations were not significant once NDD regions were removed.

Because their repeat structure makes replication error-prone, variant microsatellite lengths are often generated during germline and other somatic expansions. As such, microsatellite length variations can serve as markers for cancer. However, accurate error-free measurement of microsatellite lengths is difficult with current methods precisely because of this high error rate during amplification. We have solved this problem by using partial mutagenesis to disrupt enough of the repeat structure of initial templates so that their sequence lengths replicate faithfully. In this work, we use bisulfite mutagenesis to convert a C to a U, later read as T. Compared to untreated templates, we achieve three orders of magnitude reduction in the error rate per round of replication. By requiring agreement from two independent first copies of an initial template, we reach error rates below one in a million. We apply this method to a thousand microsatellite loci from the human genome, revealing microsatellite length distributions not observable without mutagenesis."				40750	15	archive	39	disk0/00/04/07/50	11/8/22 20:41	11/8/22 20:41	11/8/22 20:41	article	show	39	Architecture of the yeast Pol III pre-termination complex and pausing mechanism on poly(dT) termination signals	pub	9/6/22	published	10.1016/j.celrep.2022.111316	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36070694	36070694	public	Cell Reports	111316	TRUE	2211-1247	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40750	"RNA polymerase (Pol) III is specialized to transcribe short, abundant RNAs, for which it terminates transcription on polythymine (dT) stretches on the non-template (NT) strand.

Pol III recognizes the poly(dT) termination signal with subunit C128 that forms a hydrogen-bond network with the NT strand and, thereby, induces pausing.

These differences result from dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), a melanin precursor synthesized at higher levels in melanocytes from darkly pigmented skin. We used both high-throughput pharmacologic and genetic in vivo CRISPR screens to determine that DOPA limits melanocyte and melanoma cell proliferation by inhibiting the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1 (CHRM1) signaling.

BACKGROUND: PDOs have been explored as a biomarker of therapy response and for personalized therapeutics in patients with pancreatic cancer. METHODS: During 2017-2021, patients were enrolled into an IRB-approved protocol and PDO cultures were established. PDOs of interest were analyzed through a translational pipeline incorporating molecular profiling and drug sensitivity testing. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-six samples, including both surgical resections and fine needle aspiration/biopsy from 117 patients with pancreatic cancer were collected. This biobank included diversity in stage, sex, age, and race, with minority populations representing 1/3 of collected cases (16% Black, 9% Asian, 7% Hispanic/Latino). Among surgical specimens, PDO generation was successful in 71% (15 of 21) of patients who had received NAT prior to sample collection and in 76% (39 of 51) of patients who were untreated with chemotherapy or radiation at the time of collection. Pathological response to NAT correlated with PDO chemotherapy response, particularly oxaliplatin. We demonstrated the feasibility of a rapid PDO drug screen and generated data within 7 days of tissue resection. CONCLUSION: Herein we report a large single-institution organoid biobank, including ethnic minority samples. The ability to establish PDOs from chemotherapy-naive and post-NAT tissue enables longitudinal PDO generation to assess dynamic chemotherapy sensitivity profiling. PDOs can be rapidly screened and further development of rapid screening may aid in the initial stratification of patients to the most active NAT regimen."	276	3		40753	9	archive	39	disk0/00/04/07/53	11/9/22 21:38	11/9/22 21:38	11/9/22 21:38	article	show	39	A synthetic KLHL20 ligand to validate CUL3KLHL20 as a potent E3 ligase for targeted protein degradation	pub	9/1/22	published	10.1101/gad.349717.122	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36328355	36328355	restricted	Genes and Development	1031-1042	TRUE	0890-9369	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40753	"Targeted protein degradation (TPD) has risen as a promising therapeutic modality. Leveraging the catalytic nature of the ubiquitin-proteasome enzymatic machinery, TPD exhibits higher potency to eliminate disease-causing target proteins such as oncogenic transcription factors that may otherwise be difficult to abrogate by conventional inhibitors. However, there are challenges that remain. Currently, nearly all degraders engage CUL4CRBN or CUL2VHL as the E3 ligase for target ubiquitination. While their immediate efficacies are evident, the narrowed E3 ligase options make TPD vulnerable to potential drug resistance. In addition, E3 ligases show differential tissue expression and have intrinsic limitations in accessing varying types of disease-relevant targets. As the success of TPD is closely associated with the ability of E3 ligases to efficiently polyubiquitinate the target of interest, the long-term outlook of TPD drug development will depend on whether E3 ligases such as CUL4CRBN and CUL2VHL are accessible to the targets of interest. To overcome these potential caveats, a broad collection of actionable E3 ligases is required. Here, we designed a macrocyclic degrader engaging CUL3KLHL20 for targeting BET proteins and validated CUL3KLHL20 as an E3 ligase system suitable for TPD.

Among twenty-one previously healthy, deployable soldiers with non-invasive pulmonary diagnostic tests, post-deployment, all had severely decreased MEP values, averaging 42% predicted. These same patients concurrently demonstrated abnormal airways reactance (X5Hz) and peripheral/distal airways resistance (D5-D20%) via IOS, averaging - 1369% and 23% predicted, respectively. These tests support the concept of airways hyperresponsiveness and distal airways narrowing, respectively. Among the five soldiers biopsied, all had constrictive bronchiolitis. We detected the presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)-which are products of incomplete combustion-in the lung tissue of all five warfighters. All also had detectable titanium and iron in the lungs. Metals were all oxidized, supporting the concept of inhaling burned metals. Combustion temperature was consistent with that of burned petrol rather than higher temperatures noted with cigarettes. All were nonsmokers.

Various lines of evidence suggest that this form of behavioral imprinting results from reduced sensitivity of the female's accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) to the stud's chemosignals. However, the AOB's combinatorial code implies that diminishing responses to one individual will distort representations of other stimuli. Here, we record extracellular responses of AOB neurons in mated and unmated female mice while presenting urine stimuli from the stud and from other sources. We find that, while initial sensory responses in the AOB (within a timescale required to guide social interactions) remain stable, responses to extended stimulation (as required for eliciting the pregnancy block) display selective attenuation of stud-responsive neurons. Such temporal disassociation could allow attenuation of slow-acting endocrine processes in a stimulus-specific manner without compromising ongoing representations that guide behavior."	40	8		40703	5	archive	39	disk0/00/04/07/03	8/30/22 21:17	8/30/22 21:17	8/30/22 21:17	article	show	39	RNA Pol II pausing facilitates phased pluripotency transitions by buffering transcription	pub	8/18/22	published	10.1101/gad.349565.122	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35981753	35981753	restricted	Genes and Development		TRUE	0890-9369	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40703	"Promoter-proximal RNA Pol II pausing is a critical step in transcriptional control.

Here, we found that loss of Pol II pausing stalls pluripotent state transitions within the epiblast of the early mouse embryo. Using Nelfb -/- mice and a NELFB degron mouse pluripotent stem cell model, we show that embryonic stem cells (ESCs) representing the naïve state of pluripotency successfully initiate a transition program but fail to balance levels of induced and repressed genes and enhancers in the absence of NELF. We found an increase in chromatin-associated NELF during transition from the naïve to later pluripotent states. Overall, our work defines the acute and long-term molecular consequences of NELF loss and reveals a role for Pol II pausing in the pluripotency continuum as a modulator of cell state transitions."				40704	6	archive	39	disk0/00/04/07/04	8/30/22 21:43	8/30/22 21:43	8/30/22 21:43	article	show	39	Ordered and deterministic cancer genome evolution after p53 loss	pub	8/17/22	published	10.1038/s41586-022-05082-5	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35978189	35978189	public	Nature		TRUE	0028-0836	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40704	"Although p53 inactivation promotes genomic instability1 and presents a route to malignancy for more than half of all human cancers2,3, the patterns through which heterogenous TP53 (encoding human p53) mutant genomes emerge and influence tumorigenesis remain poorly understood. Here, in a mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma that reports sporadic p53 loss of heterozygosity before cancer onset, we find that malignant properties enabled by p53 inactivation are acquired through a predictable pattern of genome evolution. Single-cell sequencing and in situ genotyping of cells from the point of p53 inactivation through progression to frank cancer reveal that this deterministic behaviour involves four sequential phases-Trp53 (encoding mouse p53) loss of heterozygosity, accumulation of deletions, genome doubling, and the emergence of gains and amplifications-each associated with specific histological stages across the premalignant and malignant spectrum. Despite rampant heterogeneity, the deletion events that follow p53 inactivation target functionally relevant pathways that can shape genomic evolution and remain fixed as homogenous events in diverse malignant populations. Thus, loss of p53-the 'guardian of the genome'-is not merely a gateway to genetic chaos but, rather, can enable deterministic patterns of genome evolution that may point to new strategies for the treatment of TP53-mutant tumours."				40712	5	archive	39	disk0/00/04/07/12	9/8/22 22:02	9/8/22 22:02	9/8/22 22:02	article	show	39	Solid-basaloid variant of adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast with near complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy	pub	8/11/22	published	10.1038/s41523-022-00469-z	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35953528	35953528	public	npj Breast Cancer	93	TRUE	2374-4677	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40712	"Breast adenoid cystic carcinoma (AdCC) is a rare subtype of triple negative breast cancer.

The allelic changes are typically restricted to one or few SNPs, which potentially allow for the gradual adaptation and maturation of haplotypes. It is assumed to be a stochastic process but the analysis of archaic and modern human haplotypes revealed a striking variability in local NCO recombination rates. METHODS: NCO recombination rates of 1.9 million archaic SNPs shared with Denisovan hominids were defined by a linkage study and correlated with functional and genomic annotations as well as ChIP-Seq data from modern humans. RESULTS: We detected a strong correlation between NCO recombination rates and the function of the respective region: low NCO rates were evident in introns and quiescent intergenic regions but high rates in splice sites, exons, 5'- and 3'-UTRs, as well as CpG islands. Correlations with ChIP-Seq data from ENCODE and other public sources further identified epigenetic modifications that associated directly with these recombination events. A particularly strong association was observed for 5-hydroxymethylcytosine marks (5hmC), which were enriched in virtually all of the functional regions associated with elevated NCO rates, including CpG islands and 'poised' bivalent regions. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that 5hmC marks may guide the NCO machinery specifically towards functionally relevant regions and, as an intermediate of oxidative demethylation, may open a pathway for environmental influence by specifically targeting recently opened gene loci."	20	1	PMC9354366	40702	14	archive	39	disk0/00/04/07/02	8/23/22 22:23	8/23/22 22:23	8/23/22 22:23	article	show	39	Role of a ZF-HD Transcription Factor in miR157-Mediated Feed-Forward Regulatory Module That Determines Plant Architecture in Arabidopsis	pub	8/4/22	published	10.3390/ijms23158665	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35955798	35955798	public	International Journal of Molecular Sciences	8665	TRUE	1422-0067	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40702	"In plants, vegetative and reproductive development are associated with agronomically important traits that contribute to grain yield and biomass. Zinc finger homeodomain (ZF-HD) transcription factors (TFs) constitute a relatively small gene family that has been studied in several model plants, including Arabidopsis thaliana L. and Oryza sativa L. The ZF-HD family members play important roles in plant growth and development, but their contribution to the regulation of plant architecture remains largely unknown due to their functional redundancy. To understand the gene regulatory network controlled by ZF-HD TFs, we analyzed multiple loss-of-function mutants of ZF-HD TFs in Arabidopsis that exhibited morphological abnormalities in branching and flowering architecture. We found that ZF-HD TFs, especially HB34, negatively regulate the expression of miR157 and positively regulate SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING-LIKE 10 (SPL10), a target of miR157. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) analysis revealed that miR157D and SPL10 are direct targets of HB34, creating a feed-forward loop that constitutes a robust miRNA regulatory module. Network motif analysis contains overrepresented coherent type IV feedforward motifs in the amiR zf-HD and hbq mutant background. This finding indicates that miRNA-mediated ZF-HD feedforward modules modify branching and inflorescence architecture in Arabidopsis. Taken together, these findings reveal a guiding role of ZF-HD TFs in the regulatory network module and demonstrate its role in plant architecture in Arabidopsis."	23	15	PMC9369202	40698	15	archive	39	disk0/00/04/06/98	8/23/22 2:18	8/23/22 2:18	8/23/22 2:18	article	show	39	Transcriptomic diversity in human medullary thymic epithelial cells	pub	8/2/22	published	10.1038/s41467-022-31750-1	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35918316	35918316	public	Nature Communications	4296	TRUE	2041-1723	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40698	"The induction of central T cell tolerance in the thymus depends on the presentation of peripheral self-epitopes by medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs).

Here we map the expression of genome-wide transcripts in immature and mature human mTECs using high-throughput 5' cap and RNA sequencing. Both mTEC populations show high splicing entropy, potentially driven by the expression of peripheral splicing factors. During mTEC maturation, rates of global transcript mis-initiation increase and EREs enriched in long terminal repeat retrotransposons are up-regulated, the latter often found in proximity to differentially expressed genes.

Both of these conditions frequently co-occur, often in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. However, this phenotypic association is poorly understood. Hypothesising that the co-occurrence of trigger finger and carpal tunnel syndrome might be explained by shared germline predisposition, we aimed to identify a specific genetic locus associated with both diseases. Methods: In this genome-wide association study (GWAS), we identified 2908 patients with trigger finger and 436 579 controls from the UK Biobank prospective cohort. We conducted a case-control GWAS for trigger finger, followed by co-localisation analyses with carpal tunnel syndrome summary statistics. To identify putative causal variants and establish their biological relevance, we did fine-mapping analyses and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses, using fibroblasts from healthy donors (n=79) and tenosynovium samples from patients with carpal tunnel syndrome (n=77). We conducted a Cox regression for time to trigger finger and carpal tunnel syndrome diagnosis against plasma IGF-1 concentrations in the UK Biobank cohort. Findings: Phenome-wide analyses confirmed a marked association between carpal tunnel syndrome and trigger finger in the participants from UK Biobank (odds ratio [OR] 11·97, 95% CI 11·1–13·0; p<1 × 10−300). GWAS for trigger finger identified five independent loci, including one locus, DIRC3, that was co-localised with carpal tunnel syndrome and could be fine-mapped to rs62175241 (0·76, 0·68–0·84; p=5·03 × 10−13). eQTL analyses found a fibroblast-specific association between the protective T allele of rs62175241 and increased DIRC3 and IGFBP5 expression. Increased plasma IGF-1 concentrations were associated with both carpal tunnel syndrome and trigger finger in participants from UK Biobank (hazard ratio >1·04, p<0·02). Interpretation: In this GWAS, the DIRC3 locus on chromosome 2 was significantly associated with both carpal tunnel syndrome and trigger finger, possibly explaining their co-occurrence. The disease-protective allele of rs62175241 was associated with increased expression of long non-coding RNA DIRC3 and its transcriptional target, IGBP5, an antagonist of IGF-1 signalling. These findings suggest a model in which IGF-1 is a driver of both carpal tunnel syndrome and trigger finger, and in which the DIRC3-IGFBP5 axis directly antagonises fibroblastic IGF-1 signalling.

Refining our understanding of the genetic diversity and population structure of native and alien populations, introduction pathways, propagule pressure, naturalization, and initial spread, can transform the effectiveness of management and prevention of further introductions. We used 20,221 single nucleotide polymorphisms to reconstruct the invasion of a coastal shrub, Chrysanthemoides monilifera ssp. rotundata (bitou bush) from South Africa, into eastern Australia (EAU), and Western Australia (WAU). We determined genetic diversity and population structure across the native and introduced ranges and compared hypothesized invasion scenarios using Bayesian modeling. We detected considerable genetic structure in the native range, as well as differentiation between populations in the native and introduced range. Phylogenetic analysis showed the introduced samples to be most closely related to the southern-most native populations, although Bayesian analysis inferred introduction from a ghost population. We detected strong genetic bottlenecks during the founding of both the EAU and WAU populations. It is likely that the WAU population was introduced from EAU, possibly involving an unsampled ghost population. The number of private alleles and polymorphic SNPs successively decreased from South Africa to EAU to WAU, although heterozygosity remained high. That bitou bush remains an invasion threat in EAU, despite reduced genetic diversity, provides a cautionary biosecurity message regarding the risk of introduction of potentially invasive species via shipping routes."	12	8	PMC9396708	40699	5	archive	39	disk0/00/04/06/99	8/23/22 2:28	8/23/22 2:28	8/23/22 2:28	article	show	39	Practical Considerations for Single-Cell Genomics	pub	8/1/22	published	10.1002/cpz1.498	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35926125	35926125	none	Curr Protoc	e498	FALSE	2691-1299	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40699	"The single-cell revolution in the field of genomics is in full bloom, with clever new molecular biology tricks appearing regularly that allow researchers to explore new modalities or scale up their projects to millions of cells and beyond.

Additionally, we exploit tissue-specific variability to characterize the number of cells present during tissue-lineage commitment, ranging from approximately 20 cells in liver and whole blood tissues to 80 cells in brain tissues.

Accordingly, we established a collection of plants expressing different H4 point mutants targeting residues that may be post-translationally modified in vivo. To demonstrate its utility, we screened this new H4 mutant collection to uncover substitutions in H4 that alter flowering time. We identified different mutations in the H4 tail (H4R17A) and the H4 globular domain (H4R36A, H4R39K, H4R39A, and H4K44A) that strongly accelerate the floral transition. Furthermore, we identified a conserved regulatory relationship between H4R17 and the ISWI chromatin remodeling complex in plants: As with other biological systems, H4R17 regulates nucleosome spacing via ISWI.

ARDS secondary to transfusion-related ALI (TRALI) has been recapitulated preclinically by anti-MHC-I antibody administration to LPS-primed mice. In this model, we demonstrate that inhibitors of PTP1B, a protein tyrosine phosphatase that regulates signaling pathways of fundamental importance to homeostasis and inflammation, prevented lung injury and increased survival. Treatment with PTP1B inhibitors attenuated the aberrant neutrophil function that drives ALI and was associated with release of myeloperoxidase, suppression of neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, and inhibition of neutrophil migration. Mechanistically, reduced signaling through the CXCR4 chemokine receptor, particularly to the activation of PI3Kγ/AKT/mTOR, was essential for these effects, linking PTP1B inhibition to promoting an aged-neutrophil phenotype.

Depletion of either EZH2 or SETDB1 disrupts these stem-like cells and their associated phenotypes of spheroid formation, invasion, and tumor growth. We show that SETDB1 regulates this SCC stem cell phenotype through cooperation with ΔNp63α, an oncogenic isoform of the p53-related transcription factor p63. Furthermore, EZH2 is upstream of both SETDB1 and ΔNp63α, activating these targets via repression of the tumor suppressor RUNX3. We show that targeting this pathway with inhibitors of EZH2 results in activation of RUNX3 and repression of both SETDB1 and ΔNp63α, antagonizing the SCC cancer stem cell phenotype. This work highlights a novel pathway that drives an aggressive cancer stem cell phenotype and demonstrates a means of pharmacological intervention."				40687	5	archive	39	disk0/00/04/06/87	7/26/22 21:29	7/26/22 22:17	7/26/22 21:29	article	show	39	The application of artificial intelligence to biology and neuroscience	pub	7/21/22	published	10.1016/j.cell.2022.06.047	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35868269	35868269	none	Cell	2640-2643	TRUE	0092-8674	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40687	"Over the last decade, the artificial intelligence (AI) has undergone a revolution that is poised to transform the economy, society, and science.

However, these discoveries primarily benefit cisgender populations. Research into the effects of exogenous hormones such as estradiol, testosterone, and progesterone has direct translational benefit for TNG individuals on gender affirming hormone therapies (GAHT).

In adulthood, these hormones activate neural circuits that regulate behaviors presenting differently in females and males, such as parenting and territorial aggression. Yet long before sex-typical behaviors emerge at puberty, transient hormone production during sensitive periods of neurodevelopment establish the circuits upon which adult hormones act. How transitory waves of early-life hormone signaling exert lasting effects on the brain remains a central question. Here we discuss how perinatal estradiol signaling organizes cellular and molecular sex differences in the rodent brain. We review classic anatomic studies revealing sex differences in cell number, volume, and neuronal projections, and consider how single-cell sequencing methods enable distinction between sex-biased cell-type abundance and gene expression. Finally, we highlight the recent discovery of a gene regulatory program activated by estrogen receptor α (ERα) following the perinatal hormone surge. A subset of this program displays sustained sex-biased gene expression and chromatin accessibility throughout the postnatal sensitive period, demonstrating a bona fide epigenetic mechanism.

Phospholipids are important metabolites in plant responses to low-temperature and phosphorus availability and have been suggested to influence flowering time. Here, we combined linkage mapping with genome scans to identify High PhosphatidylCholine 1 (HPC1), a gene that encodes a phospholipase A1 enzyme, as a major driver of phospholipid variation in highland maize. Common garden experiments demonstrated strong genotype-by-environment interactions associated with variation at HPC1, with the highland HPC1 allele leading to higher fitness in highlands, possibly by hastening flowering. The highland maize HPC1 variant resulted in impaired function of the encoded protein due to a polymorphism in a highly conserved sequence. A meta-analysis across HPC1 orthologs indicated a strong association between the identity of the amino acid at this position and optimal growth in prokaryotes. Mutagenesis of HPC1 via genome editing validated its role in regulating phospholipid metabolism. Finally, we showed that the highland HPC1 allele entered cultivated maize by introgression from the wild highland teosinte Zea mays ssp. mexicana and has been maintained in maize breeding lines from the Northern United States, Canada, and Europe. Thus, HPC1 introgressed from teosinte mexicana underlies a large metabolic QTL that modulates phosphatidylcholine levels and has an adaptive effect at least in part via induction of early flowering time."	119	27		40679	3	archive	39	disk0/00/04/06/79	7/27/22 4:23	7/27/22 4:23	7/27/22 4:23	article	show	39	FoxA1 and FoxA2 control growth and cellular identity in NKX2-1-positive lung adenocarcinoma	pub	7/5/22	published	10.1016/j.devcel.2022.06.017	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35835117	35835117	none	Developmental Cell		TRUE	1534-5807	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40679	"Changes in cellular identity (also known as histologic transformation or lineage plasticity) can drive malignant progression and resistance to therapy in many cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).

However, their role in NKX2-1-positive LUAD has not been systematically investigated. We find that Foxa1/2 knockout severely impairs tumorigenesis in KRAS-driven genetically engineered mouse models and human cell lines. Loss of FoxA1/2 leads to the collapse of a dual-identity state, marked by co-expression of pulmonary and gastrointestinal transcriptional programs, which has been implicated in LUAD progression. Mechanistically, FoxA1/2 loss leads to aberrant NKX2-1 activity and genomic localization, which in turn actively inhibits tumorigenesis and drives alternative cellular identity programs that are associated with non-proliferative states.

Heterozygous single flower truss (sft) mutants in the florigen SFT gene in the background of sp-classic provide a heterosis-like effect by delaying shoot termination, suggesting the subtle suppression of determinacy by genetic modification of the florigen-antiflorigen balance could improve yield. Here, we isolated three new sp alleles from the tomato germplasm that show modified determinate growth compared to sp-classic, including one allele that mimics the effect of sft heterozygosity. Two deletion alleles eliminated functional transcripts and showed similar shoot termination, determinate growth, and yields as sp-classic. In contrast, amino acid substitution allele sp-5732 showed semi-determinate growth with more leaves and sympodial shoots on all shoots. This translated to greater yield compared to the other stronger alleles by up to 42%. Transcriptome profiling of axillary (sympodial) shoot meristems (SYM) from sp-classic and wild type plants revealed six mis-regulated genes related to the floral transition, which were used as biomarkers to show that the maturation of SYMs in the weaker sp-5732 genotype is delayed compared to sp-classic, consistent with delayed shoot termination and semi-determinate growth. Assessing sp allele frequencies from over 500 accessions indicated that one of the strong sp alleles (sp-2798) arose in early breeding cultivars but was not selected. The newly discovered sp alleles are potentially valuable resources to quantitatively manipulate shoot growth and yield in determinate breeding programs, with sp-5732 providing an opportunity to develop semi-determinate field varieties with higher yields."	23	13	PMC9266710	40711	5	archive	39	disk0/00/04/07/11	9/8/22 21:42	9/8/22 21:42	9/8/22 21:42	article	show	39	Evaluating the differential expression of TAM family receptors and efferocytosis activities in differentiated and polarized THP-1 macrophage	pub	6/21/22	published	10.1101/2022.06.21.497076	https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.21.497076v1	497076v1	none	biorxiv		FALSE		https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40711					40669	7	archive	39	disk0/00/04/06/69	6/30/22 23:42	6/30/22 23:42	6/30/22 23:42	article	show	39	Quantitative relationship between cerebrovascular network and neuronal cell types in mice	pub	6/21/22	published	10.1016/j.celrep.2022.110978	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35732133	35732133	public	Cell Reports	110978	TRUE	2211-1247	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40669	"The cerebrovasculature and its mural cells must meet brain regional energy demands, but how their spatial relationship with different neuronal cell types varies across the brain remains largely unknown.

However, how CRYs interpret light quantity to regulate growth in plants remains poorly understood. Furthermore, CRY2 protein levels and activity are tightly regulated in light to fine-tune hypocotyl growth; however, details of the mechanisms that explain precise control of CRY2 levels are not fully understood. We show that in Arabidopsis, UBP12 and UBP13 deubiquitinases physically interact with CRY2 in light. UBP12/13 negatively regulates CRY2 by promoting its ubiquitination and turnover to modulate hypocotyl growth. Growth and development were explicitly affected in blue light when UBP12/13 were disrupted or overexpressed, indicating their role alongside CRY2. UBP12/13 also interacted with and stabilized COP1, which is partially required for CRY2 turnover. Our combined genetic and molecular data support a mechanistic model in which UBP12/13 interact with CRY2 and COP1, leading to the stabilization of COP1.

Understanding the behavior of neutrophils as they act within various inflammatory contexts has provided insights into their role in sterile and infectious diseases; however, the field of neutrophils in cancer is comparatively young. Here, we summarize key concepts and current knowledge gaps related to the diverse roles of neutrophils throughout cancer progression. We discuss sources of neutrophil heterogeneity in cancer and provide recommendations on nomenclature for neutrophil states that are distinct in maturation and activation. We address discrepancies in the literature that highlight a need for technical standards that ought to be considered between laboratories. Finally, we review emerging questions in neutrophil biology and innate immunity in cancer. Overall, we emphasize that neutrophils are a more diverse population than previously appreciated and that their role in cancer may present novel unexplored opportunities to treat cancer."	219	6	PMC9086501	40665	4	archive	39	disk0/00/04/06/65	6/24/22 17:43	6/24/22 17:43	6/24/22 17:43	article	show	39	Achieving STEM diversity: Fix the classrooms	pub	6/3/22	published	10.1126/science.abn9515	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35653460	35653460	public	Science	1057-1059	FALSE	0036-8075	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40665	Outdated teaching methods amount to discrimination.	376	6597		40660	12	archive	39	disk0/00/04/06/60	6/23/22 23:00	6/23/22 23:00	6/23/22 23:00	article	show	39	"Genome-wide association analysis and replication in 810,625 individuals with varicose veins"	pub	6/2/22	published	10.1038/s41467-022-30765-y	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35654884	35654884	public	Nature Communications	3065	TRUE	2041-1723	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40660	"Varicose veins affect one-third of Western society, with a significant subset of patients developing venous ulceration, costing $14.9 billion annually in the USA.

Picornavirus RNAs, whose 5' termini are shielded by a genome-linked protein, are predominately recognized by MDA5. This has important ramifications for adaptive immunity, as MDA5-specific patterns of type-I interferon (IFN) release are optimal for CD4+T cell TH1 polarization and CD8+T cell priming. We are exploiting this principle for cancer immunotherapy with recombinant poliovirus (PV), PVSRIPO, the type 1 (Sabin) PV vaccine containing a rhinovirus type 2 internal ribosomal entry site (IRES). Here we show that PVSRIPO-elicited MDA5 signaling is preceded by early sensing of the IRES by the double-stranded (ds)RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR). PKR binding to IRES stem-loop domains 5-6 led to dimerization and autoactivation, displaced host translation initiation factors, and suppressed viral protein synthesis. Early PKR-mediated antiviral responses tempered incipient viral translation and the activity of cytopathogenic viral proteinases, setting up accentuated MDA5 innate inflammation in response to PVSRIPO infection. IMPORTANCE Among the RIG-I-like pattern recognition receptors, MDA5 stands out because it senses long dsRNA duplexes independent of their 5' features (RIG-I recognizes viral [v]RNA 5'-ppp blunt ends). Uniquely among RNA viruses, the innate defense against picornaviruses is controlled by MDA5. We show that prior to engaging MDA5, recombinant PV RNA is sensed upon PKR binding to the viral IRES at a site that overlaps with the footprint for host translation factors mediating 40S subunit recruitment. Our study demonstrates that innate antiviral type-I IFN responses orchestrated by MDA5 involve separate innate modules that recognize distinct vRNA features and interfere with viral functions at multiple levels."				40651	8	archive	39	disk0/00/04/06/51	6/8/22 18:54	6/8/22 18:54	6/8/22 18:54	article	show	39	Redox-engineering enhances maize thermotolerance and grain yield in the field	pub	6/2/22	published	10.1111/pbi.13866	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35656643	35656643	public	Plant Biotechnology Journal		TRUE	1467-7644	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40651	"Increasing populations and temperatures are expected to escalate food demands beyond production capacities, and the development of maize lines with better performance under heat stress is desirable.

The sRNA is used as a guide to target mRNAs containing either partially or fully complementary sequences, ultimately leading to downregulation of the corresponding proteins. It was previously shown that the kinase CK1α phosphorylates a cluster of residues in the eukaryotic insertion (EI) of Ago, leading to the alleviation of miRNA-mediated repression through an undetermined mechanism. We show that binding of miRNA-loaded human Ago2 to target RNA with complementarity to the seed and 3' supplementary regions of the miRNA primes the EI for hierarchical phosphorylation by CK1α. The added negative charges electrostatically promote target release, freeing Ago to seek out additional targets once it is dephosphorylated. The high conservation of potential phosphosites in the EI suggests that such a regulatory strategy may be a shared mechanism for regulating miRNA-mediated repression."	11			40714	4	archive	39	disk0/00/04/07/14	9/8/22 22:34	9/8/22 22:34	9/8/22 22:34	article	show	39	Internally-controlled and dynamic optical measures of functional tumor biology	pub	5/31/22	published	10.1101/2022.05.30.493733			none	biorxiv		FALSE		https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40714					40645	6	archive	39	disk0/00/04/06/45	6/2/22 17:19	6/2/22 17:19	6/2/22 17:19	article	show	39	Structural insights into binding of therapeutic channel blockers in NMDA receptors	pub	5/30/22	published	10.1038/s41594-022-00772-0	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35637422	35637422	none	Nature Structural and Molecular Biology		TRUE	1545-9993	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40645	"Excitatory signaling mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) is critical for brain development and function, as well as for neurological diseases and disorders.

However, emerging evidence shows that under some conditions, oxytocin can instead induce anxiety-related behaviors. These diverse effects of oxytocin appear to be mediated by circuit-specific actions. Recent data showed that inhibition of oxytocin receptors (OTRs) in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) was sufficient to increase social approach and decrease social vigilance in female California mice (Peromyscus californicus) exposed to social defeat stress. As a member of the G-protein coupled receptor family, OTRs can induce distinct downstream pathways by coupling to different G-protein isoforms. We show that infusion of carbetocin, a biased OTR-Gq agonist, in the BNST reduced social approach in both female and male California mice. In both females and males, carbetocin also increased social vigilance. To gain insight into cell types that could be mediating this effect, we analyzed previously published single-cell RNAseq data from the BNST and nucleus accumbens (NAc). In the NAc, we and others showed that OTR activation promotes social approach behaviors. In the BNST, Oxtr was expressed in over 40 cell types, that span both posterior and anterior subregions of the BNST. The majority of Oxtr-expressing neurons were GABAergic. In the anterior regions of BNST targeted in our carbetocin experiments, Cyp26b1-expressing neurons had high average Oxtr expression. In the NAc, most Oxtr+ cells were D1 dopamine receptor-expressing neurons and interneurons. These differences in Oxtr cell type distribution may help explain how activation of OTR in BNST versus NAc can have different effects on social approach and social vigilance."	143			40650	7	archive	39	disk0/00/04/06/50	6/8/22 18:44	6/8/22 18:44	6/8/22 18:44	article	show	39	Sleep Disruption and Cancer: Chicken or the Egg?	pub	5/19/22	published	10.3389/fnins.2022.856235	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35663547	35663547	public	Frontiers in Neuroscience	856235	TRUE	1662-4548	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40650	"Sleep is a nearly ubiquitous phenomenon across the phylogenetic tree, highlighting its essential role in ensuring fitness across evolutionary time. Consequently, chronic disruption of the duration, timing, or structure of sleep can cause widespread problems in multiple physiological systems, including those that regulate energy balance, immune function, and cognitive capacity, among others. Many, if not all these systems, become altered throughout the course of cancer initiation, growth, metastatic spread, treatment, and recurrence. Recent work has demonstrated how changes in sleep influence the development of chronic diseases, including cancer, in both humans and animal models. A common finding is that for some cancers (e.g., breast), chronic disruption of sleep/wake states prior to disease onset is associated with an increased risk for cancer development. Additionally, sleep disruption after cancer initiation is often associated with worse outcomes. Recently, evidence suggesting that cancer itself can affect neuronal circuits controlling sleep and wakefulness has accumulated. Patients with cancer often report difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, and severe fatigue, during and even years after treatment. In addition to the psychological stress associated with cancer, cancer itself may alter sleep homeostasis through changes to host physiology and via currently undefined mechanisms. Moreover, cancer treatments (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation, hormonal, and surgical) may further worsen sleep problems through complex biological processes yet to be fully understood. This results in a ""chicken or the egg"" phenomenon, where it is unclear whether sleep disruption promotes cancer or cancer reciprocally disrupts sleep. This review will discuss existing evidence for both hypotheses and present a framework through which the interactions between sleep and cancer can be dissociated and causally investigated."	16		PMC9160986	40610	5	archive	39	disk0/00/04/06/10	5/18/22 13:51	5/18/22 13:51	5/18/22 13:51	article	show	39	OCA-T1 and OCA-T2 are coactivators of POU2F3 in the tuft cell lineage	pub	5/16/22	published	10.1038/s41586-022-04842-7	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35576971	35576971	none	Nature		TRUE	0028-0836	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40610	"Tuft cells are a rare chemosensory lineage that coordinates immune and neural responses to foreign pathogens in mucosal tissues1.

Recent observational and clinical studies suggest famotidine, a histamine 2 receptor (H2R) antagonist widely used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease, attenuates the clinical course of COVID-19. Because evidence is lacking for a direct antiviral activity of famotidine, a proposed mechanism of action is blocking the effects of histamine released by mast cells. Here we hypothesized that famotidine activates the inflammatory reflex, a brain-integrated vagus nerve mechanism which inhibits inflammation via alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) signal transduction, to prevent cytokine storm. METHODS: The potential anti-inflammatory effects of famotidine and other H2R antagonists were assessed in mice exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cytokine storm. As the inflammatory reflex is integrated and can be stimulated in the brain, and H2R antagonists penetrate the blood brain barrier poorly, famotidine was administered by intracerebroventricular (ICV) or intraperitoneal (IP) routes. RESULTS: Famotidine administered IP significantly reduced serum and splenic LPS-stimulated tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-6 concentrations, significantly improving survival. The effects of ICV famotidine were significantly more potent as compared to the peripheral route. Mice lacking mast cells by genetic deletion also responded to famotidine, indicating the anti-inflammatory effects are not mast cell-dependent. Either bilateral sub-diaphragmatic vagotomy or genetic knock-out of α7nAChR abolished the anti-inflammatory effects of famotidine, indicating the inflammatory reflex as famotidine's mechanism of action. While the structurally similar H2R antagonist tiotidine displayed equivalent anti-inflammatory activity, the H2R antagonists cimetidine or ranitidine were ineffective even at very high dosages. CONCLUSIONS: These observations reveal a previously unidentified vagus nerve-dependent anti-inflammatory effect of famotidine in the setting of cytokine storm which is not replicated by high dosages of other H2R antagonists in clinical use. Because famotidine is more potent when administered intrathecally, these findings are also consistent with a primarily central nervous system mechanism of action."	28	1	PMC9109205	40619	8	archive	39	disk0/00/04/06/19	5/25/22 14:54	5/25/22 14:54	5/25/22 14:54	article	show	39	Sorghum root epigenetic landscape during limiting phosphorus conditions	pub	5/14/22	published	10.1002/pld3.393	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35600998	35600998	public	Plant Direct	e393	TRUE	2475-4455	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40619	"Efficient acquisition and use of available phosphorus from the soil is crucial for plant growth, development, and yield.

Multiple TLS polymerases exist with different damage tolerance capabilities, since they have low fidelity their access to the replication fork must be regulated to minimize mutations. The current paradigm is that a combination of kinetic partitioning and protein-protein interactions are used to regulate TLS polymerase activity. A major knowledge-gap in elucidating the roles of these polymerases is that it is difficult to identify which polymerase is active in a specific situation. We designed and synthesized a novel nucleotide analog N2 -benzyl- 2'-deoxyguanosine (EBndG) that is highly selective toward DNA polymerase kappa (Pol κ), a Y family TLS polymerase. Pol k can bypass bulky lesions in the minor groove generated by a metabolite benzo[a]pyrene diolepoxide (BPDE), an environmental carcinogen. Although Pol κ has been identified to have multiple cellular roles, the mechanisms regulating its different cellular activities are unknown. To interrogate the identity of proteins surrounding the Pol κ active sites, we performed an extensive study using modified iPOND (isolation of proteins on nascent DNA), called iPoKD (isolation of proteins on Pol kappa synthesized DNA). Human cell lines were treated with BPDE, subsequently 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) or EBndG was added and proteins bound to the DNA containing EdU and EBndG were analyzed by mass spectrometry. In addition, we performed quantitative analysis of the Pol κ active sites interactome using iPoKD followed by iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation). Our data identified DNA replication and repair proteins previously identified with EdU pull-downs; and interestingly enrichment of RNA binding, ribosome biogenesis, nucleolar proteins and transcriptional repressive complex(es) associated with EBndG pull-downs. Chromatin modifiers, histone chaperones and histone variants are identified suggesting changes in chromatin structure that facilitates Pol κ-mediated DNA lesion bypass, repair and restorative process. identification of unique proteins associated with EBndG-containing DNA, suggests novel roles for Pol κ's activity in the cell. Using super-resolution confocal microscopy, Pol κ activity is identified in the nucleolus after BPDE damage. EBndG is observed in the nucleolar DNA and Pol κ 's activity regulated by the canonical polycomb-complex recruited by the PARylation of PARP1. BPDE lead to transcriptional stress and repression that is gradually recovered.

Redistribution of plant species in particular disrupts key structure-function relationships in the soil by altering the composition of microbial taxa. This study combines environmental DNA analysis with a goat-grazing intervention to investigate the taxonomic structure of soil microbiomes interacting with the invasive plant, Rhamnus cathartica (common Buckthorn). 16S (515F/806R) metabarcodes were amplified from soil DNA harvested before and after a goat-grazing regimen on buckthorn-invaded and control plots. Samples were sequenced on an Illumina iSeq, then analyzed using the DNA Subway Purple Line (QIIME 2.0) to process sequencing reads and calculate diversity indices. PCoA visualizations of Jaccard Beta diversity patterns revealed differences in community composition between buckthorn and control soils, but no effects from goat grazing. Five dominant taxa were identified in no-buckthorn control soils, accounting for 35 +/- 9.6 SD% of the average relative abundance of total sequences. Genus DA101 notably demonstrated the largest decrease in average relative abundance in the buckthorn and goat-grazed soils (% decrease = 6.4 +/- 2 SD), whereas the evenness of other taxa increased. Overall, buckthorn soil showed significant increases in Pielou's taxonomical evenness (Kruskal-Wallis H(2, N=29) = 10.9; p=0.004), but goat grazing had no impact on this score (p>0.01). Faith's phylogenetic diversity scores showed no significant differences between buckthorn, goat-grazed, and control soils (Kruskal-Wallis H(2, N=31) = 2.2; p=0.32). Taken together, these preliminary results illustrate that buckthorn increases taxonomical evenness but has no effect on overall phylogenetic diversity of soil communities. Moreover, buckthorn goat-grazing had little impact on soil community structure. Future studies will investigate the role of DA101 on buckthorn suppression as a possible mitigation strategy for this invasive species."	36 Sup			40648	5	archive	39	disk0/00/04/06/48	6/2/22 18:09	6/2/22 18:09	6/2/22 18:09	article	show	39	Identification of Genetic Factors Controlling the Formation of Multiple Flowers Per Node in Pepper (Capsicum spp.)	pub	5/9/22	published	10.3389/fpls.2022.884338	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35615119	35615119	public	Frontiers in Plant Science	884338	TRUE	1664-462X	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40648	"Flower production provides the foundation for crop yield and increased profits.

In the cortex, these fast-spiking cells provide feedforward and feedback synaptic inhibition onto a diverse set of cell types, including pyramidal cells, other inhibitory interneurons, and themselves. Cortical inhibitory networks broadly, and cortical parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (cPVins) specifically, are crucial for regulating sensory plasticity during both development and adulthood. Here we review the functional properties of cPVins that enable plasticity in the cortex of adult mammals and the influence of cPVins on sensory activity at four spatiotemporal scales. First, cPVins regulate developmental critical periods and adult plasticity through molecular and structural interactions with the extracellular matrix. Second, they activate in precise sequence following feedforward excitation to enforce strict temporal limits in response to the presentation of sensory stimuli. Third, they implement gain control to normalize sensory inputs and compress the dynamic range of output. Fourth, they synchronize broad network activity patterns in response to behavioral events and state changes. Much of the evidence for the contribution of cPVins to plasticity comes from classic models that rely on sensory deprivation methods to probe experience-dependent changes in the brain. We support investigating naturally occurring, adaptive cortical plasticity to study cPVin circuits in an ethologically relevant framework, and discuss recent insights from our work on maternal experience-induced auditory cortical plasticity."	16		PMC9120417	40608	11	archive	39	disk0/00/04/06/08	5/17/22 14:20	5/17/22 14:20	5/17/22 14:20	article	show	39	Comparative optimization of combinatorial CRISPR screens	pub	5/5/22	published	10.1038/s41467-022-30196-9	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35513429	35513429	public	Nature Communications	2469	TRUE	2041-1723	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40608	"Combinatorial CRISPR technologies have emerged as a transformative approach to systematically probe genetic interactions and dependencies of redundant gene pairs.

Here we identify a metabolite signalling pathway that provides actionable insights towards this goal. We perform a dietary screen in autochthonous animal models of CRC and find that ketogenic diets exhibit a strong tumour-inhibitory effect. These properties of ketogenic diets are recapitulated by the ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), which reduces the proliferation of colonic crypt cells and potently suppresses intestinal tumour growth. We find that BHB acts through the surface receptor Hcar2 and induces the transcriptional regulator Hopx, thereby altering gene expression and inhibiting cell proliferation. Cancer organoid assays and single-cell RNA sequencing of biopsies from patients with CRC provide evidence that elevated BHB levels and active HOPX are associated with reduced intestinal epithelial proliferation in humans. This study thus identifies a BHB-triggered pathway regulating intestinal tumorigenesis and indicates that oral or systemic interventions with a single metabolite may complement current prevention and treatment strategies for CRC."	605	7908		40600	13	archive	39	disk0/00/04/06/00	5/2/22 20:06	5/2/22 20:06	5/2/22 20:06	article	show	39	A preclinical platform for assessing antitumor effects and systemic toxicities of cancer drug targets	pub	4/26/22	published	10.1073/pnas.2110557119	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35442775	35442775	public	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of USA	e2110557119	TRUE	0027-8424	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40600	"SignificanceMany new cancer drugs fail at the clinical stage owing to poor efficacy and/or excessive toxicity, though whether this reflects shortcomings of the target or the drug is often unclear.

The primary Arabidopsis nuclear reference genome contains less than half of the numt because of its structural complexity and repetitiveness. Recent data sets generated with improved long-read sequencing technologies (PacBio HiFi) provide an opportunity to finally determine the accurate sequence and structure of this numt.

Nanopore sequencing data indicate that the numt has high levels of cytosine methylation, helping to explain its biased spectrum of nucleotide sequence divergence and supporting previous inferences that it is transcriptionally inactive.

Upon transcription, single nucleotide variants (SNVs) may alter mRNA structure, with potential impacts on transcript stability, macromolecular interactions, and translation. However, plant genomes have not been assessed for the presence of these structure-altering polymorphisms or ""riboSNitches."" RESULTS: We experimentally demonstrate the presence of riboSNitches in transcripts of two Arabidopsis genes, ZINC RIBBON 3 (ZR3) and COTTON GOLGI-RELATED 3 (CGR3), which are associated with continentality and temperature variation in the natural environment. These riboSNitches are also associated with differences in the abundance of their respective transcripts, implying a role in regulating the gene's expression in adaptation to local climate conditions. We then computationally predict riboSNitches transcriptome-wide in mRNAs of 879 naturally inbred Arabidopsis accessions. We characterize correlations between SNPs/riboSNitches in these accessions and 434 climate descriptors of their local environments, suggesting a role of these variants in local adaptation. We integrate this information in CLIMtools V2.0 and provide a new web resource, T-CLIM, that reveals associations between transcript abundance variation and local environmental variation. CONCLUSION: We functionally validate two plant riboSNitches and, for the first time, demonstrate riboSNitch conditionality dependent on temperature, coining the term ""conditional riboSNitch.""

Mutational inactivation of TP53 is the most common somatic event in LT, however the mechanisms by which TP53 mutations promote LT remain unresolved. Using an allelic series of mouse models of Jak2/Trp53 mutant MPN, we identify that only biallelic inactivation of Trp53 results in LT (to a pure erythroleukemia (PEL)). This PEL arises from the megakaryocyte erythroid progenitor (MEP) population. Importantly, the BMP2/SMAD pathway is aberrantly activated during LT, and results in abnormal self-renewal of MEPs. Finally, we identify that Jak2/Trp53 mutant PEL is characterized by recurrent copy number alterations and DNA damage. Using a synthetic-lethality strategy, by targeting active DNA-repair pathways, we demonstrate that this PEL is highly sensitive to combination WEE1 and PARP inhibition. These observations yield new mechanistic insights into the process of p53 mutant LT, and offer new, clinically-translatable therapeutic approaches."				40598	6	archive	39	disk0/00/04/05/98	5/2/22 14:26	5/2/22 14:26	5/2/22 14:26	article	show	39	Genetic and environmental determinants of diastolic heart function	pub	4/13/22	published	10.1038/s44161-022-00048-2	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35479509	35479509	public	Nat Cardiovasc Res	361-371	TRUE	2731-0590	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40598	"Diastole is the sequence of physiological events that occur in the heart during ventricular filling and principally depends on myocardial relaxation and chamber stiffness.

As high repeat content and genomic divergence are substantial challenges in plant genome alignment, we also explored the effect of different masking approaches and parameters of the LAST aligner using genome assemblies of 33 grass species. Compared with conventional masking with RepeatMasker, a masking approach based on k-mers (nucleotide sequences of k length) increased the alignment rate of coding sequence and noncoding functional regions by 25 and 14%, respectively. We further found that default alignment parameters generally perform well, but parameter tuning can increase the alignment rate for noncoding functional regions by over 52% compared with default LAST settings. Finally, by increasing alignment sensitivity from the default baseline, parameter tuning can increase the number of noncoding sites that can be scored for conservation by over 76%.

Loss of fructose metabolism is also apparent in hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma (HCC) patient samples. KHK overexpression in liver cancer cells results in decreased fructose flux through glycolysis. We then developed a strategy to detect this metabolic switch in vivo using hyperpolarized magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Uniformly deuterating [2-13C]-fructose and dissolving in D2O increased its spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) fivefold, enabling detection of F1P and its loss in models of HCC.

Using RNA-seq, we directly compare TDP-43-mediated RNA processing in muscle (C2C12) and neuronal (NSC34) mouse cells. TDP-43 displays a cell-type-characteristic behaviour targeting unique transcripts in each cell-type, which is due to characteristic expression of RNA-binding proteins, that influence TDP-43's performance and define cell-type specific splicing.

PDOs may improve clinical next-generation sequencing (NGS) and enable rapid ex vivo chemotherapeutic screening (pharmacotyping). METHODS: PDOs were derived from tissues obtained during surgical resection and endoscopic biopsies and studied with NGS and pharmacotyping. PDO-specific pharmacotype is assessed prospectively as a predictive biomarker of clinical therapeutic response by leveraging data from a randomized-controlled clinical trial. RESULTS: Clinical sequencing pipelines often fail to detect PDAC-associated somatic mutations in surgical specimens that demonstrate a good pathological response to previously administered chemotherapy. Sequencing the PDOs derived from these surgical specimens, after biomass expansion, improves the detection of somatic mutations and enables quantification of copy number variants. The detection of clinically relevant mutations and structural variants is improved following PDO biomass expansion. On clinical trial, PDOs were derived from biopsies of treatment naïve patients prior to treatment with FOLFIRINOX (FFX). Ex vivo PDO pharmacotyping with FFX components predicted clinical therapeutic response in these patients with borderline resectable or locally advanced PDAC treated in a neoadjuvant or induction paradigm. PDO pharmacotypes suggesting sensitivity to FFX components were associated with longitudinal declines of tumor marker, CA-19-9 and favorable RECIST imaging response. CONCLUSION: PDOs establishment from tissues obtained from patients previously receiving cytotoxic chemotherapies can be accomplished in a clinically-certified laboratory. Sequencing PDOs following biomass expansion improves clinical sequencing quality. High in-vitro sensitivity to standard-of-care chemotherapeutics predicts good clinical response to systemic chemotherapy in PDAC."				40568	16	archive	39	disk0/00/04/05/68	4/7/22 14:14	4/7/22 14:14	4/7/22 14:14	article	show	39	Epigenetic patterns in a complete human genome	pub	4/1/22	published	10.1126/science.abj5089	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35357915	35357915	none	Science	eabj5089	TRUE	0036-8075	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40568	"The completion of a telomere-to-telomere human reference genome, T2T-CHM13, has resolved complex regions of the genome, including repetitive and homologous regions.

While virtually all TP53 mutations are thought to compromise wild type p53 activity, the prevalence and recurrence of missense TP53 alleles has motivated countless research studies aimed at understanding the function of the resulting mutant p53 protein. The data from these studies support three distinct, but perhaps not necessarily mutually exclusive, mechanisms for how different p53 mutants impact cancer: first, they lose the ability to execute wild type p53 functions to varying degrees; second, they act as a dominant negative (DN) inhibitor of wild type p53 tumor-suppressive programs; and third, they may gain oncogenic functions that go beyond mere p53 inactivation. Of these possibilities, the gain of function (GOF) hypothesis is the most controversial, in part due to the dizzying array of biological functions that have been attributed to different mutant p53 proteins. Herein we discuss the current state of understanding of TP53 allele variation in cancer and recent reports that both support and challenge the p53 GOF model. In these studies and others, researchers are turning to more systematic approaches to profile TP53 mutations, which may ultimately determine once and for all how different TP53 mutations act as cancer drivers and whether tumors harboring distinct mutations are phenotypically unique.

Here we describe a forward genetic approach to the identification of regulators of selective KN1 trafficking through PD, using a trichome rescue system that permits simple visual analysis in Arabidopsis leaves. A KN1 trafficking regulator identified in this approach had the capacity to regulate the transport not only of KN1 but also of another mobile regulatory protein, TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA1 (TTG1). Our system could be easily adapted to reveal the mechanism underlying the selective transport of additional mobile signals through PD."	2457			40583	12	archive	39	disk0/00/04/05/83	4/14/22 13:31	4/14/22 13:31	4/14/22 13:31	article	show	39	Genome-wide identification and analysis of prognostic features in human cancers	pub	3/29/22	published	10.1016/j.celrep.2022.110569	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35354049	35354049	public	Cell Reports	110569	TRUE	2211-1247	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40583	"Clinical decisions in cancer rely on precisely assessing patient risk.

We identified more than 100,000 significant prognostic biomarkers and demonstrate that these genomic features can predict patient outcomes in clinically ambiguous situations. While adverse biomarkers are commonly believed to represent cancer driver genes and promising therapeutic targets, we show that cancer features associated with shorter survival times are not enriched for either oncogenes or for successful drug targets. Instead, the strongest adverse biomarkers represent widely expressed cell-cycle and housekeeping genes, and, correspondingly, nearly all therapies directed against these features have failed in clinical trials. In total, our analysis establishes a rich resource for prognostic biomarker analysis and clarifies the use of patient survival data in preclinical cancer research and therapeutic development."	38	13		40562	6	archive	39	disk0/00/04/05/62	4/1/22 15:05	4/1/22 15:05	4/1/22 15:05	article	show	39	Dynamic evolution of small signalling peptide compensation in plant stem cell control	pub	3/28/22	published	10.1038/s41477-022-01118-w	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35347264	35347264	none	Nature Plants		TRUE	2055-0278	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40562	"Gene duplications are a hallmark of plant genome evolution and a foundation for genetic interactions that shape phenotypic diversity1-5. Compensation is a major form of paralogue interaction6-8 but how compensation relationships change as allelic variation accumulates is unknown. Here we leveraged genomics and genome editing across the Solanaceae family to capture the evolution of compensating paralogues. Mutations in the stem cell regulator CLV3 cause floral organs to overproliferate in many plants9-11. In tomato, this phenotype is partially suppressed by transcriptional upregulation of a closely related paralogue12. Tobacco lost this paralogue, resulting in no compensation and extreme clv3 phenotypes. Strikingly, the paralogues of petunia and groundcherry nearly completely suppress clv3, indicating a potent ancestral state of compensation. Cross-species transgenic complementation analyses show that this potent compensation partially degenerated in tomato due to a single amino acid change in the paralogue and cis-regulatory variation that limits its transcriptional upregulation. Our findings show how genetic interactions are remodelled following duplications and suggest that dynamic paralogue evolution is widespread over short time scales and impacts phenotypic variation from natural and engineered mutations."				40559	6	archive	39	disk0/00/04/05/59	3/31/22 18:36	3/31/22 18:36	3/31/22 18:36	article	show	39	Convergent selection of a WD40 protein that enhances grain yield in maize and rice	pub	3/25/22	published	10.1126/science.abg7985	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35324310	35324310	none	Science	eabg7985	TRUE	0036-8075	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40559	"A better understanding of the extent of convergent selection among crops could greatly improve breeding programs.

The 3-year DFS was significantly higher in the pCR group compared to non-pCR group (95% vs 91 %, p = 0.03) and the same trend was observed for overall survival. In our cohort, despite the better survival outcomes of patients who achieved pCR, we did not observe appreciable differences in the incidence of BM by pCR/non-pCR status.

AvrLep2 was cloned using a biparental cross of avirulent and virulent L. maculans isolates and a classical map-based cloning approach. Taking these two approaches independently, we found that AvrLmS and AvrLep2 are the same gene. Complementation of virulent isolates with this gene confirmed its role in inducing resistance on Surpass 400, Topas-LepR2, and an RlmS-line. The gene, renamed AvrLmS-Lep2, encodes a small cysteine-rich protein of unknown function with an N-terminal secretory signal peptide, which is a common feature of the majority of effectors from extracellular fungal plant pathogens. The AvrLmS-Lep2/LepR2 interaction phenotype was found to vary from a typical hypersensitive response through intermediate resistance sometimes towards susceptibility, depending on the inoculation conditions. AvrLmS-Lep2 was nevertheless sufficient to significantly slow the systemic growth of the pathogen and reduce the stem lesion size on plant genotypes with LepR2, indicating the potential efficiency of this resistance to control the disease in the field."

We identified 47 epidermal growth factor receptor/BRAF inhibitor-naive CRC patients with dual RAS hotspot/BRAF V600E mutations (CRC-DD) from a cohort of 4,561 CRC patients with clinical next-generation sequencing results. We aimed to define the molecular phenotypes of the CRC-DD and to test if the dual RAS hotspot/BRAF V600E mutations coexist within the same cell. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a single-cell genotyping method with a mutation detection rate of 96.3% and a genotype prediction accuracy of 92.1%. Mutations in the CRC-DD cohort were analyzed for clonality, allelic imbalance, copy number, and overall survival. RESULTS: Application of single-cell genotyping to four CRC-DD revealed the co-occurrence of both mutations in the following percentages of cells per case: NRAS G13D/KRAS G12C, 95%; KRAS G12D/NRAS G12V, 48%; BRAF V600E/KRAS G12D, 44%; and KRAS G12D/NRAS G13V, 14%, respectively. Allelic imbalance favoring the oncogenic allele was less frequent in CRC-DD (24 of 76, 31.5%, somatic mutations) compared with a curated cohort of CRC with a single-driver mutation (CRC-SD; 119 of 232 mutations, 51.3%; P = .013). Microsatellite instability-high status was enriched in CRC-DD compared with CRC-SD (23% v 11.4%, P = .028). Of the seven CRC-DD cases with multiregional sequencing, five retained both driver mutations throughout all sequenced tumor sites. Both CRC-DD cases with discordant multiregional sequencing were microsatellite instability-high. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that dual-driver mutations occur in a rare subset of CRC, often within the same tumor cells and across multiple tumor sites. Their presence and a lower rate of allelic imbalance may be related to dose-dependent signaling within the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway."	6	6		40582	8	archive	39	disk0/00/04/05/82	4/13/22 22:05	4/13/22 22:05	4/13/22 22:05	article	show	39	A flexible Bayesian framework for unbiased estimation of timescales	pub	3/1/22	published	10.1038/s43588-022-00214-3	https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-022-00214-3	-217	public	Nature Computational Science	193-204	TRUE	2662-8457	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40582	Timescales characterize the pace of change for many dynamic processes in nature. They are usually estimated by fitting the exponential decay of data autocorrelation in the time or frequency domain. Here we show that this standard procedure often fails to recover the correct timescales due to a statistical bias arising from the finite sample size. We develop an alternative approach to estimate timescales by fitting the sample autocorrelation or power spectrum with a generative model based on a mixture of Ornstein–Uhlenbeck processes using adaptive approximate Bayesian computations. Our method accounts for finite sample size and noise in data and returns a posterior distribution of timescales that quantifies the estimation uncertainty and can be used for model selection. We demonstrate the accuracy of our method on synthetic data and illustrate its application to recordings from the primate cortex. We provide a customizable Python package that implements our framework via different generative models suitable for diverse applications.	2	3		40551	7	archive	39	disk0/00/04/05/51	3/11/22 15:28	3/11/22 15:28	3/11/22 15:28	article	show	39	A feedback control principle common to several biological and engineered systems	pub	3/1/22	published	10.1098/rsif.2021.0711	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35232277	35232277	public	Journal of the Royal Society Interface	20210711	TRUE	1742-5662	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40551	"Feedback control is used by many distributed systems to optimize behaviour. Traditional feedback control algorithms spend significant resources to constantly sense and stabilize a continuous control variable of interest, such as vehicle speed for implementing cruise control, or body temperature for maintaining homeostasis. By contrast, discrete-event feedback (e.g. a server acknowledging when data are successfully transmitted, or a brief antennal interaction when an ant returns to the nest after successful foraging) can reduce costs associated with monitoring a continuous variable; however, optimizing behaviour in this setting requires alternative strategies. Here, we studied parallels between discrete-event feedback control strategies in biological and engineered systems. We found that two common engineering rules-additive-increase, upon positive feedback, and multiplicative-decrease, upon negative feedback, and multiplicative-increase multiplicative-decrease-are used by diverse biological systems, including for regulating foraging by harvester ant colonies, for maintaining cell-size homeostasis, and for synaptic learning and adaptation in neural circuits. These rules support several goals of these systems, including optimizing efficiency (i.e. using all available resources); splitting resources fairly among cooperating agents, or conversely, acquiring resources quickly among competing agents; and minimizing the latency of responses, especially when conditions change. We hypothesize that theoretical frameworks from distributed computing may offer new ways to analyse adaptation behaviour of biology systems, and in return, biological strategies may inspire new algorithms for discrete-event feedback control in engineering."	19	188	PMC8889180	40534	10	archive	41	disk0/00/04/05/34	3/2/22 15:12	3/2/22 15:12	3/2/22 15:12	article	show		Bayes and Darwin: How replicator populations implement Bayesian computations	pub	2/25/22	published				none	"BioEssays : news and reviews in molecular, cellular and developmental biology"	e2100255	FALSE	1521-1878	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40534	"Bayesian learning theory and evolutionary theory both formalize adaptive competition dynamics in possibly high-dimensional, varying, and noisy environments.

We discuss how these mechanisms provide analogous answers to the challenge of adapting to stochastically changing environments at multiple timescales. We elucidate an algorithmic equivalence between a sampling approximation, particle filters, and the Wright-Fisher model of population genetics.

LC activity is thought to multiplex distinct signals by superimposing sustained ('tonic') firing patterns reflecting global brain states, such as arousal and anxiety, and rapidly fluctuating ('phasic') bursts signaling discrete behaviorally significant events. Manipulations of the LC noradrenergic system broadly impair social behavior, but the temporal structure of LC firing and its relationship to social interaction is unknown. One possibility is that tonic firing may increase in the presence of social partners; it is also possible that phasic bursts may accompany specific social events. We used chronic in vivo electrophysiology and fiber photometry to measure single unit and population neural activity in LC of freely behaving mice during their interactions with pups. We find that pup retrieval elicits remarkably precise phasic activity in LC that can't be attributed merely to sensory stimuli, motor activity, or reward. Correlation of LC activity with retrieval events shows that phasic events are most closely related to specific subsequent behaviors. The reliability and magnitude of phasic responses strongly suggest that these events are coordinated across LC and broadcast NA release throughout the brain. We also observed slow changes in tonic firing when females performed distinct maternal behaviors such as nest building and pup grooming. We therefore propose that LC signals state changes during sustained interactions and contributes to goal-directed action selection during social behavior with globally-broadcast NA release.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTLocus coeruleus (LC) releases noradrenaline (NA) brain-wide influencing many cognitive, emotional, and physiological processes. Multifunctionality of LC is maintained by multiplexing NA signaling via brief 'phasic' patterns of bursting and slowly changing 'tonic' firing. Manipulations of NA impair social behavior, yet the structure of LC activity with respect to specific social events is unknown. We measured LC activity in mice freely interacting with pups. We find that pup retrieval elicits precisely timed and pervasive phasic activation of LC that anticipates specific behaviors. We also found that LC neurons exhibited slow fluctuations in firing during sustained behaviors. We propose that LC simultaneously contributes to goal-directed social action selection with globally-broadcast NA release, and signals social state changes with increased tonic firing."

Chromosome 2 of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana contains one of the largest known nuclear insertions of mitochondrial DNA (numts). Estimated at over 600 kb in size, this numt is larger than the entire Arabidopsis mitochondrial genome. The primary Arabidopsis nuclear reference genome contains less than half of the numt because of its structural complexity and repetitiveness. Recent datasets generated with improved long-read sequencing technologies (PacBio HiFi) provide an opportunity to finally determine the accurate sequence and structure of this numt. We performed a de novo assembly using sequencing data from recent initiatives to span the Arabidopsis centromeres, producing a gap-free sequence of the Chromosome 2 numt, which is 641-kb in length and has 99.933% nucleotide sequence identity with the actual mitochondrial genome. The numt assembly is consistent with the repetitive structure previously predicted from fiber-based fluorescent in situ hybridization. Nanopore sequencing data indicate that the numt has high levels of cytosine methylation, helping to explain its biased spectrum of nucleotide sequence divergence and supporting previous inferences that it is transcriptionally inactive. The original numt insertion appears to have involved multiple mitochondrial DNA copies with alternative structures that subsequently underwent an additional duplication event within the nuclear genome.

However, these roles have been controversial in mammals. Strikingly, we found that Dicer-deficient embryonic stem cells have strong proliferation and chromosome segregation defects as well as increased transcription of centromeric satellite repeats, which triggers the interferon response. We conducted a CRISPR-Cas9 genetic screen to restore viability and identified transcriptional activators, histone H3K9 methyltransferases, and chromosome segregation factors as suppressors, resembling Dicer suppressors identified in independent screens in fission yeast. The strongest suppressors were mutations in the transcriptional co-activator Brd4, which reversed the strand-specific transcription of major satellite repeats suppressing the interferon response, and in the histone acetyltransferase Elp3. We show that identical mutations in the second bromodomain of Brd4 rescue Dicer-dependent silencing and chromosome segregation defects in both mammalian cells and fission yeast. This remarkable conservation demonstrates that RNA interference has an ancient role in transcriptional silencing and in particular of satellite repeats, which is essential for cell cycle progression and proper chromosome segregation.

Previous work revealed the emergence of multisensory interactions in the auditory cortex (AC) of both dams and virgins who co-habitate with pups (‘surrogates’). Here we identify a neural pathway that integrates information about odors with responses to sound. We found that a scattered population of glutamatergic neurons in the basal amygdala (BA) projects to the AC and responds to odors, including the smell of pups. These neurons also exhibit increased activity when the surrogate female is searching for pups. Finally, we show that selective optogenetic activation of BA-AC neurons modulates responses to pup calls, and that this modulation switches from predominantly suppressive to predominantly excitatory after maternal experience. This supports an underappreciated role for the amygdala in directly shaping sensory representations in an experience-dependent manner.

This mode of adaptation can be characterized quantitatively by a spectrum of adaptive substitutions, i.e., a distribution for types of changes fixed in adaptation. Recent work establishes that the changes involved in adaptation reflect common types of mutations, raising the question of how strongly the mutation spectrum shapes the spectrum of adaptive substitutions. We address this question with a codon-based model for the spectrum of adaptive amino acid substitutions, applied to three large datasets covering thousands of amino acid changes identified in natural and experimental adaptation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Escherichia coli, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis Using species-specific mutation spectra based on prior knowledge, we find that the mutation spectrum has a proportional influence on the spectrum of adaptive substitutions in all three species. Indeed, we find that by inferring the mutation rates that best explain the spectrum of adaptive substitutions, we can accurately recover the species-specific mutation spectra. However, we also find that the predictive power of the model differs substantially between the three species. To better understand these differences, we use population simulations to explore the factors that influence how closely the spectrum of adaptive substitutions mirrors the mutation spectrum.

Recent advances and emerging technologies in artificial intelligence (AI), coupled with the ever-increasing availability of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, now provide researchers with unprecedented possibilities for dynamic and complex biological genomic analyses. Combining these technologies may lead to a deeper understanding of heterogeneous polygenic CVDs, better prognostic guidance, and, ultimately, greater personalized medicine.

This review discusses the current opportunities and limitations of genomics; provides a brief overview of AI; and identifies the current applications, limitations, and future directions of AI in genomics.</jats:p>"	12	2		40471	5	archive	39	disk0/00/04/04/71	12/30/21 16:36	12/30/21 16:36	12/30/21 16:36	article	show	39	Computational validity: using computation to translate behaviours across species	pub	2/14/22	published	10.1098/rstb.2020.0525	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34957854	34957854	none	Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences	20200525	TRUE	0962-8436	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40471	"We propose a new conceptual framework (computational validity) for translation across species and populations based on the computational similarity between the information processing underlying parallel tasks. Translating between species depends not on the superficial similarity of the tasks presented, but rather on the computational similarity of the strategies and mechanisms that underlie those behaviours. Computational validity goes beyond construct validity by directly addressing questions of information processing. Computational validity interacts with circuit validity as computation depends on circuits, but similar computations could be accomplished by different circuits. Because different individuals may use different computations to accomplish a given task, computational validity suggests that behaviour should be understood through the subject's point of view; thus, behaviour should be characterized on an individual level rather than a task level. Tasks can constrain the computational algorithms available to a subject and the observed subtleties of that behaviour can provide information about the computations used by each individual. Computational validity has especially high relevance for the study of psychiatric disorders, given the new views of psychiatry as identifying and mediating information processing dysfunctions that may show high inter-individual variability, as well as for animal models investigating aspects of human psychiatric disorders.

Here, we describe modular base-editing-activity 'sensors' that link sgRNAs and cognate target sites in cis and use them to systematically measure the editing efficiency and precision of thousands of sgRNAs paired with functionally distinct base editors. By quantifying sensor editing across >200,000 editor-sgRNA combinations, we provide a comprehensive resource of sgRNAs for introducing and interrogating cancer-associated single nucleotide variants in multiple model systems. We demonstrate that sensor-validated tools streamline production of in vivo cancer models and that integrating sensor modules in pooled sgRNA libraries can aid interpretation of high-throughput base editing screens. Using this approach, we identify several previously uncharacterized mutant TP53 alleles as drivers of cancer cell proliferation and in vivo tumor development.

DESIGN: Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fully remote, phase 2 clinical trial (NCT04724720) enrolling symptomatic unvaccinated adult outpatients with confirmed COVID-19 between January 2021 and April 2021 from two US centres. Patients self-administered 80 mg famotidine (n=28) or placebo (n=27) orally three times a day for 14 consecutive days. Endpoints were time to (primary) or rate of (secondary) symptom resolution, and resolution of inflammation (exploratory). RESULTS: Of 55 patients in the intention-to-treat group (median age 35 years (IQR: 20); 35 women (64%); 18 African American (33%); 14 Hispanic (26%)), 52 (95%) completed the trial, submitting 1358 electronic symptom surveys. Time to symptom resolution was not statistically improved (p=0.4). Rate of symptom resolution was improved for patients taking famotidine (p<0.0001). Estimated 50% reduction of overall baseline symptom scores were achieved at 8.2 days (95% CI: 7 to 9.8 days) for famotidine and 11.4 days (95% CI: 10.3 to 12.6 days) for placebo treated patients. Differences were independent of patient sex, race or ethnicity. Five self-limiting adverse events occurred (famotidine, n=2 (40%); placebo, n=3 (60%)). On day 7, fewer patients on famotidine had detectable interferon alpha plasma levels (p=0.04). Plasma immunoglobulin type G levels to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid core protein were similar between both arms. CONCLUSIONS: Famotidine was safe and well tolerated in outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Famotidine led to earlier resolution of symptoms and inflammation without reducing anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity. Additional randomised trials are required."

We developed a cancer mouse model in which tumor-specific CD8 T cells (TST cells) encounter tumor antigens with varying TCR signal strength. High-signal-strength interactions caused TST cells to up-regulate inhibitory receptors (IRs), lose effector function, and establish a dysfunction-associated molecular program. TST cells undergoing low-signal-strength interactions also up-regulated IRs, including PD1, but retained a cell-intrinsic functional state. Surprisingly, neither high- nor low-signal-strength interactions led to tumor control in vivo, revealing two distinct mechanisms by which PD1hi TST cells permit tumor escape; high signal strength drives dysfunction, while low signal strength results in functional inertness, where the signal strength is too low to mediate effective cancer cell killing by functional TST cells. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated fine-tuning of signal strength to an intermediate range improved anti-tumor activity in vivo.

In its core procedure, the ancestral background of the profiled patient is replaced with one of any number of individuals with known ancestry. Data synthesis is applicable to multiple profiling platforms and makes it possible to assess the performance of inference separately for each continental-level ancestry. This ability extends to all ancestries, including those without statistically sufficient representation in the existing cancer data. We further show that our inference procedure is accurate and robust in a wide range of sequencing depths. Testing our approach for three representative cancer types, and across three molecular profiling modalities, we demonstrate that global, continental-level ancestry of the patient can be inferred with high accuracy, as quantified by its agreement with the golden standard of the ancestry derived from matching cancer-free molecular data.

Aromatase inhibitors are more effective than tamoxifen in postmenopausal women but are ineffective in premenopausal women when used without ovarian suppression. We aimed to investigate whether premenopausal women treated with ovarian suppression benefit from aromatase inhibitors. METHODS: We did a meta-analysis of individual patient data from randomised trials comparing aromatase inhibitors (anastrozole, exemestane, or letrozole) versus tamoxifen for 3 or 5 years in premenopausal women with ER-positive breast cancer receiving ovarian suppression (goserelin or triptorelin) or ablation. We collected data on baseline characteristics, dates and sites of any breast cancer recurrence or second primary cancer, and dates and causes of death. Primary outcomes were breast cancer recurrence (distant, locoregional, or contralateral), breast cancer mortality, death without recurrence, and all-cause mortality. As distant recurrence invariably results in death from breast cancer several years after the occurrence, whereas locoregional recurrence and new contralateral breast cancer are not usually fatal, the distant recurrence analysis is shown separately. Standard intention-to-treat log-rank analyses estimated first-event rate ratios (RR) and their confidence intervals (CIs). FINDINGS: We obtained data from all four identified trials (ABCSG XII, SOFT, TEXT, and HOBOE trials), which included 7030 women with ER-positive tumours enrolled between June 17, 1999, and Aug 4, 2015. Median follow-up was 8·0 years (IQR 6·1-9·3). The rate of breast cancer recurrence was lower for women allocated to an aromatase inhibitor than for women assigned to tamoxifen (RR 0·79, 95% CI 0·69-0·90, p=0·0005). The main benefit was seen in years 0-4 (RR 0·68, 99% CI 0·55-0·85; p<0·0001), the period when treatments differed, with a 3·2% (95% CI 1·8-4·5) absolute reduction in 5-year recurrence risk (6·9% vs 10·1%). There was no further benefit, or loss of benefit, in years 5-9 (RR 0·98, 99% CI 0·73-1·33, p=0·89) or beyond year 10. Distant recurrence was reduced with aromatase inhibitor (RR 0·83, 95% CI 0·71-0·97; p=0·018). No significant differences were observed between treatments for breast cancer mortality (RR 1·01, 95% CI 0·82-1·24; p=0·94), death without recurrence (1·30, 0·75-2·25; p=0·34), or all-cause mortality (1·04, 0·86-1·27; p=0·68). There were more bone fractures with aromatase inhibitor than with tamoxifen (227 [6·4%] of 3528 women allocated to an aromatase inhibitor vs 180 [5·1%] of 3502 women allocated to tamoxifen; RR 1·27 [95% CI 1·04-1·54]; p=0·017). Non-breast cancer deaths (30 [0·9%] vs 24 [0·7%]; 1·30 [0·75-2·25]; p=0·36) and endometrial cancer (seven [0·2%] vs 15 [0·3%]; 0·52 [0·22-1·23]; p=0·14) were rare. INTERPRETATION: Using an aromatase inhibitor rather than tamoxifen in premenopausal women receiving ovarian suppression reduces the risk of breast cancer recurrence. Longer follow-up is needed to assess any impact on breast cancer mortality.

Tumors arising in these mice recapitulate the metastatic patterns and histological, molecular, and treatment response features of the human disease. By leveraging these models, we show that the ability to undergo senescence underlies the clinically observed increase in sensitivity of homologous recombination (HR)-deficient HGSOC tumors to platinum-based chemotherapy. Further, cGas/STING-mediated activation of a restricted senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) was sufficient to induce immune infiltration and sensitize HR-deficient tumors to immune checkpoint blockade. In sum, our study identifies senescence propensity as a predictor of therapy response and defines a limited SASP profile that appears sufficient to confer added vulnerability to concurrent immunotherapy and, more broadly, provides a blueprint for the implementation of electroporation-based mouse models to reveal mechanisms of oncogenesis and therapy response in HGSOC."	119	5		40523	10	archive	39	disk0/00/04/05/23	2/23/22 15:29	3/2/22 15:14	2/23/22 15:29	article	show	39	Early Neutrophilia Marked by Aerobic Glycolysis Sustains Host Metabolism and Delays Cancer Cachexia	pub	2/1/22	published	10.3390/cancers14040963			public	Cancers	963-963	TRUE	2072-6694	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40523	"An elevated neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio negatively predicts the outcome of patients with cancer and is associated with cachexia, the terminal wasting syndrome.

Transcriptomic and metabolic assessment reveals that neutrophils in tumor-bearing animals utilize aerobic glycolysis, similar to cancer cells. Although pharmacological inhibition of aerobic glycolysis slows down tumor growth in C26 tumor-bearing mice, it precipitates cachexia, thereby shortening the overall survival. This negative effect may be explained by our observation that acute depletion of neutrophils in pre-cachectic mice impairs systemic glucose homeostasis secondary to altered hepatic lipid processing. Thus, changes in neutrophil number, distribution, and metabolism play an adaptive role in host metabolic homeostasis during cancer progression.

However, the functional consequences of SMARCA4 mutation on tumor initiation, progression, and chromatin regulation in lung cancer remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that loss of Smarca4 sensitizes club cell secretory protein-positive cells within the lung in a cell type-dependent fashion to malignant transformation and tumor progression, resulting in highly advanced dedifferentiated tumors and increased metastatic incidence. Consistent with these phenotypes, Smarca4-deficient primary tumors lack lung lineage transcription factor activities and resemble a metastatic cell state. Mechanistically, we show that Smarca4 loss impairs the function of all three classes of SWI/SNF complexes, resulting in decreased chromatin accessibility at lung lineage motifs and ultimately accelerating tumor progression. Thus, we propose that the SWI/SNF complex via Smarca4 acts as a gatekeeper for lineage-specific cellular transformation and metastasis during lung cancer evolution. SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrate cell-type specificity in the tumor-suppressive functions of SMARCA4 in the lung, pointing toward a critical role of the cell-of-origin in driving SWI/SNF-mutant lung adenocarcinoma.

It has been proposed that, in σ-dependent pausing, the RNAP active center can access off-pathway “backtracked” states that are substrates for the transcript-cleavage factors of the Gre family, and on-pathway “scrunched” states that mediate pause escape. Here, using site-specific protein-DNA photocrosslinking to define positions of the RNAP trailing and leading edges and of σ relative to DNA at the λPR’ promoter, we show directly that σ-dependent pausing in the absence of GreB in vitro predominantly involves a state backtracked by 2-4 bp, and that σ-dependent pausing in the presence of GreB in vitro and in vivo predominantly involves a state scrunched by 2-3 bp. Analogous experiments with a library of 47 (∼16,000) transcribed-region sequences show that the state scrunched by 2-3 bp--and only that state--is associated with the consensus sequence, T-3N-2Y-1G+1, (where -1 corresponds to the position of the RNA 3’ end), which is identical to the consensus for pausing in initial transcription, and which is related to the consensus for pausing in transcription elongation. Experiments with heteroduplex templates show that sequence information at position T-3 resides in the DNA nontemplate strand. A cryo-EM structure of a complex engaged in σ-dependent pausing reveals positions of DNA scrunching on the DNA nontemplate and template strands and suggests that position T-3 of the consensus sequence exerts its effects by facilitating scrunching."				40499	8	archive	39	disk0/00/04/04/99	1/26/22 14:48	2/10/22 16:49	1/26/22 14:48	article	show	39	"P63 targeted deletion under the FOXN1 promoter disrupts pre-and post-natal thymus development, function and maintenance as well as induces severe hair loss"	pub	1/25/22		10.1371/journal.pone.0261770	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35077450/	5077450/	public	PLoS One		TRUE	1932-6203	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40499	"Progressive immune deficiency of aging is characterized by severe thymic atrophy, contracted T cell repertoire, and poor immune function. p63 is critical for the proliferative potential of embryonic and adult stem cells, as well as thymic epithelial cells (TECs). Because p63 null mice experience rapid post-natal lethality due to epidermal and limb morphogenesis defects, studies to define a role for p63 expression in TEC biology focused on embryonic thymus development and in vitro experiments. Since post-natal thymic stromal development and function differs from that of the embryo, we assessed the impact of lineage-restricted p63 loss on pre- and post-natal murine TEC function by generating mice with a loss of p63 function targeted to TEC, termed p63 TECko mice. In adult p63 TECko mice, severe thymic hypoplasia was observed with a lack in a discernable segregation into medullary and cortical compartments and peripheral T cell lymphopenia. This profound thymic defect was seen in both neonatal as well as embryonic p63 TECko mice.

Interestingly, all adult p63 TECko mice lacked hair follicles despite having normal p63 expression in the skin.

Mouse tumors containing control PDA cells exhibited the CXCL12-KRT19 coating, excluded T cells, and did not respond to treatment with anti-PD-1 antibody. Tumors containing PDA cells not expressing either KRT19 or TGM2 lacked the CXCL12-KRT19 coating, were infiltrated with activated CD8+ T cells, and growth was suppressed with anti-PD-1 antibody treatment.

This study, used a combination of domain architecture phylostratigraphy and phylogenetic reconstruction to investigate the evolutionary history of embryo patterning and auxin metabolism (EPAM) genes in Viridiplantae. This approach shed light on the co-optation of auxin metabolism and other molecular mechanisms that contributed to the radiation of land plants, and specifically to embryo formation. These results have potential to assist conservation programs, by directing the development of tools for obtaining somatic embryos. In this context, we employed this methodology with critically endangered and non-model species Araucaria angustifolia, the Brazilian pine, which is current focus of conservation efforts using somatic embryogenesis. So far, this approach had little success since somatic embryos fail to completely develop.

HMGB1 significantly attenuates EPO-mediated phosphorylation of the JAK2/STAT5 and mTOR signaling pathways. Genetic ablation of RAGE, the only known HMGB1 receptor expressed by erythroid precursors, does not rescue the deleterious effects of HMGB1 on EPO signaling, either in human or murine precursors. Furthermore, surface plasmon resonance studies highlight the ability of HMGB1 to interfere with the binding between EPO and the EPOR.

Although Trikafta and other CFTR-modulation therapies benefit most CF patients, targeted therapy for patients with the W1282X mutation is lacking. The CFTR-W1282X protein has residual activity but is expressed at a very low level due to nonsense-mediated messenger RNA (mRNA) decay (NMD). NMD-suppression therapy and read-through therapy are actively being researched for CFTR nonsense mutants. NMD suppression could increase the mutant CFTR mRNA, and read-through therapies may increase the levels of full-length CFTR protein. However, these approaches have limitations and potential side effects: because the NMD machinery also regulates the expression of many normal mRNAs, broad inhibition of the pathway is not desirable, and read-through drugs are inefficient partly because the mutant mRNA template is subject to NMD. To bypass these issues, we pursued an exon-skipping antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) strategy to achieve gene-specific NMD evasion. A cocktail of two splice-site-targeting ASOs induced the expression of CFTR mRNA without the premature-termination-codon-containing exon 23 (CFTR-Δex23), which is an in-frame exon. Treatment of human bronchial epithelial cells with this cocktail of ASOs that target the splice sites flanking exon 23 results in efficient skipping of exon 23 and an increase in CFTR-Δex23 protein. The splice-switching ASO cocktail increases the CFTR-mediated chloride current in human bronchial epithelial cells.

The effect of host switching of D. citri between Citrus medica (citron) and M. paniculata plants on the acquisition and transmission of CLas was investigated. The psyllid CLas titer and the proportion of CLas-infected psyllids decreased in the generations after transfer from CLas-infected citron to healthy M. paniculata plants.

These features strongly limit the success of immunotherapy as a single agent, thereby suggesting the need for the development of a multitargeted approach. The goal is to foster T lymphocyte infiltration within the tumor landscape and neutralize cancer-triggered immune suppression, to enhance the therapeutic effectiveness of immune-based treatments, such as anticancer adoptive cell therapy (ACT). METHODS: We examined the contribution of immunosuppressive myeloid cells expressing arginase 1 and nitric oxide synthase 2 in building up a reactive nitrogen species (RNS)-dependent chemical barrier and shaping the PDAC immune landscape. We examined the impact of pharmacological RNS interference on overcoming the recruitment and immunosuppressive activity of tumor-expanded myeloid cells, which render pancreatic cancers resistant to immunotherapy. RESULTS: PDAC progression is marked by a stepwise infiltration of myeloid cells, which enforces a highly immunosuppressive microenvironment through the uncontrolled metabolism of L-arginine by arginase 1 and inducible nitric oxide synthase activity, resulting in the production of large amounts of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. The extensive accumulation of myeloid suppressing cells and nitrated tyrosines (nitrotyrosine, N-Ty) establishes an RNS-dependent chemical barrier that impairs tumor infiltration by T lymphocytes and restricts the efficacy of adoptive immunotherapy. A pharmacological treatment with AT38 ([3-(aminocarbonyl)furoxan-4-yl]methyl salicylate) reprograms the tumor microenvironment from protumoral to antitumoral, which supports T lymphocyte entrance within the tumor core and aids the efficacy of ACT with telomerase-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Tumor microenvironment reprogramming by ablating aberrant RNS production bypasses the current limits of immunotherapy in PDAC by overcoming immune resistance."	10	1	PMC8756272	40503	6	archive	39	disk0/00/04/05/03	1/27/22 14:25	1/27/22 14:25	1/27/22 14:25	article	show	39	"Inverting the model of genomics data sharing with the NHGRI Genomic Data Science Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-space"	pub	1/12/22	published	10.1016/j.xgen.2021.100085			public	Cell Genomics	100085-100085	TRUE	2666-979X	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40503	"The NHGRI Genomic Data Science Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-space (AnVIL; https://anvilproject.org) was developed to address a widespread community need for a unified computing environment for genomics data storage, management, and analysis.

The HD-ZIP I transcription factor gene GRASSY TILLERS1 (GT1) is one of only a few genes known to regulate this process. To identify additional regulators of carpel suppression, we performed a gt1 enhancer screen and found a genetic interaction between gt1 and ramosa3 (ra3). RA3 is a classic inflorescence meristem determinacy gene that encodes a trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P) phosphatase (TPP). Dissection of floral development revealed that ra3 single mutants have partially derepressed carpels, whereas gt1;ra3 double mutants have completely derepressed carpels. Surprisingly, gt1 suppresses ra3 inflorescence branching, revealing a role for gt1 in meristem determinacy. Supporting these genetic interactions, GT1 and RA3 proteins colocalize to carpel nuclei in developing flowers. Global expression profiling revealed common genes misregulated in single and double mutant flowers, as well as in derepressed gt1 axillary meristems. Indeed, we found that ra3 enhances gt1 vegetative branching, similar to the roles for the trehalose pathway and GT1 homologs in the eudicots. This functional conservation over ∼160 million years of evolution reveals ancient roles for GT1-like genes and the trehalose pathway in regulating axillary meristem suppression, later recruited to mediate carpel suppression. Our findings expose hidden pleiotropy of classic maize genes and show how an ancient developmental program was redeployed to sculpt floral form."	119	2	PMC8764674	40491	9	archive	39	disk0/00/04/04/91	1/20/22 15:07	2/2/22 18:16	1/20/22 15:07	article	show	39	SCP4-STK35/PDIK1L complex is a dual phospho-catalytic signaling dependency in acute myeloid leukemia	pub	1/11/22	published	10.1016/j.celrep.2021.110233	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35021089	35021089	public	Cell Reports	110233	TRUE	2211-1247	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40491	"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells rely on phospho-signaling pathways to gain unlimited proliferation potential.

We developed a network model in which the On-Off dynamics propagate across nearby columns generating spatial correlations with the extent controlled by attentional inputs. This mechanism, unlike previous proposals, predicts spatially non-uniform changes in correlations during attention. We confirm this prediction in our columnar recordings by showing that in superficial layers the largest changes in correlations occur at intermediate lateral distances. Our results reveal how spatially structured patterns of correlated variability emerge through interactions of cortical state dynamics, anatomical connectivity, and attention."	13	1	PMC8748999	40498	7	archive	39	disk0/00/04/04/98	1/20/22 16:35	1/28/22 14:13	1/20/22 16:35	article	show	39	Systematic characterization of short intronic splicing-regulatory elements in SMN2 pre-mRNA.	pub	1/8/22	published	10.1093/nar/gkab1280	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35018432	35018432	public	Nucleic Acids Research		TRUE	0305-1048	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40498	"Intronic splicing enhancers and silencers (ISEs and ISSs) are two groups of splicing-regulatory elements (SREs) that play critical roles in determining splice-site selection, particularly for alternatively spliced introns or exons. SREs are often short motifs; their mutation or dysregulation of their cognate proteins frequently causes aberrant splicing and results in disease. To date, however, knowledge about SRE sequences and how they regulate splicing remains limited. Here, using an SMN2 minigene, we generated a complete pentamer-sequence library that comprises all possible combinations of 5 nucleotides in intron 7, at a fixed site downstream of the 5' splice site. We systematically analyzed the effects of all 1023 mutant pentamers on exon 7 splicing, in comparison to the wild-type minigene, in HEK293 cells. Our data show that the majority of pentamers significantly affect exon 7 splicing: 584 of them are stimulatory and 230 are inhibitory. To identify actual SREs, we utilized a motif set enrichment analysis (MSEA), from which we identified groups of stimulatory and inhibitory SRE motifs. We experimentally validated several strong SREs in SMN1/2 and other minigene settings. Our results provide a valuable resource for understanding how short RNA sequences regulate splicing. Many novel SREs can be explored further to elucidate their mechanism of action."

IVM through surgically inserted imaging windows is particularly powerful because it allows longitudinal observation of the same tissue over days to weeks. Typical imaging windows comprise a glass coverslip in a biocompatible metal frame sutured to the mouse's skin. These windows can interfere with the free movement of the mice, elicit a strong inflammatory response, and fail due to broken glass or torn sutures, any of which may necessitate euthanasia. To address these issues, windows for long-term abdominal organ and mammary gland imaging were developed from a thin film of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), an optically clear silicone polymer previously used for cranial imaging windows. These windows can be glued directly to the tissues, reducing the time needed for insertion. PDMS is flexible, contributing to its durability in mice over time-up to 35 days have been tested. Longitudinal imaging is imaging of the same tissue region during separate sessions. A stainless-steel grid was embedded within the windows to localize the same region, allowing the visualization of dynamic processes (like mammary gland involution) at the same locations, days apart. This silicone window also allowed monitoring of single disseminated cancer cells developing into micro-metastases over time. The silicone windows used in this study are simpler to insert than metal-framed glass windows and cause limited inflammation of the imaged tissues. Moreover, embedded grids allow for straightforward tracking of the same tissue region in repeated imaging sessions."		179		40478	8	archive	39	disk0/00/04/04/78	1/12/22 15:15	1/12/22 15:15	1/12/22 15:15	article	show	39	The Impact of Fasciation on Maize Inflorescence Architecture	pub	1/4/22	published	10.1007/s12374-021-09342-1			public	Journal of Plant Biology		TRUE	1226-9239	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40478	"How functional genetics research can be applied to improving crop yields is a timely challenge.

Treatment with MEK inhibitor monotherapy has not been successful in clinical trials to date. Compensatory activation of FGFR1 was identified as a mechanism of trametinib resistance in KRAS-mutant NSCLC, and combination therapy with trametinib and ponatinib was synergistic in in vitro and in vivo models. This study sought to evaluate this drug combination in patients with KRAS-mutant NSCLC. Methods: A phase 1 dose escalation study of trametinib and ponatinib was conducted in patients with advanced NSCLC with KRAS mutations. A standard 3-plus-3 dose escalation was done. Patients were treated with the study therapy until intolerable toxicity or disease progression. Results: A total of 12 patients with KRAS-mutant NSCLC were treated (seven at trametinib 2 mg and ponatinib 15 mg, five at trametinib 2 mg and ponatinib 30 mg). Common toxicities observed were rash, diarrhea, and fever. Serious adverse events potentially related to therapy were reported in five patients, including one death in the study and four cardiovascular events. Serious events were observed at both dose levels. Of note, 75% (9 of 12) were assessable for radiographic response and no confirmed partial responses were observed. The median time on study was 43 days. Conclusions: In this phase 1 study, in patients with KRAS-mutant advanced NSCLC, combined treatment with trametinib and ponatinib was associated with cardiovascular and bleeding toxicities. Exploring the combination of MEK and FGFR1 inhibition in future studies is potentially warranted but alternative agents should be considered to improve safety and tolerability."	3	1		40473	6	archive	39	disk0/00/04/04/73	1/5/22 16:51	1/5/22 16:51	1/5/22 16:51	article	show	39	"Maize genetics, genomics, and sustainable improvement"	pub	1/1/22	published	10.1007/s11032-021-01266-5			none	Molecular Breeding: new strategies in plant improvement		FALSE	1380-3743	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40473		42	1		40479	6	archive	39	disk0/00/04/04/79	1/13/22 19:19	1/13/22 19:19	1/13/22 19:19	article	show	39	ICGC-ARGO precision medicine: familial matters in pancreatic cancer	pub	1/1/22	published	10.1016/S1470-2045(21)00703-8			none	The Lancet Oncology	25-26	TRUE	1470-2045	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40479	"The International Cancer Genome Consortium–Accelerating Research in Genomic Oncology (ICGC-ARGO)1 will analyse the tumours of more than 100 000 patients with cancer during the next 10 years in a standardised way, using high-quality multiomic and clinical data (in particular outcome and treatment information) to address outstanding questions that are vital to our quest to defeat cancer (ie, the delineation of markers of prognosis, therapeutic response, and resistance).

RESULTS: Fifty-one patients with minimal change CP were identified. Thirty-three patients were felt to have advanced CP, and 135 patients did not have CP by clinical criteria. The peak bicarbonate and total volume of pancreatic juice collected was significantly different (P < 0.001) between all 3 groups by multiple comparison testing. The peak bicarbonate of advanced CP and minimal change groups was less than controls (P < 0.001).

Microbes associated with these particles likely vary with organic substrate lability and redox conditions. To explore microbial compositional responses to these variables, we analyzed particle-associated and free-living assemblages in the permanently redox-stratified Fayetteville Green Lake using 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing during the peak and end of cyanobacterial and photoautotrophic sulfur bacterial blooms. Assemblage compositions were strongly influenced by redox conditions and particle association. Assemblage compositions varied seasonally above the lower oxycline boundary (summer—generalist heterotrophs; autumn—iron reducers and specialist heterotrophs), but not in the anoxic region below. Particle-associated assemblages were less diverse than free-living assemblages and were dominated by heterotrophs that putatively metabolize complex organic substrates, purple sulfur bacteria, sulfur-cycling Desulfocapsa, and eukaryotic algae. The least diverse particle-associated assemblages occurred near the lower oxycline boundary, where microbial activities and abundances were highest, and anoxygenic photoautotrophs were enriched. The low-diversity particle-associated heterotrophs likely remineralize complex organic substrates, releasing simpler organic substrates to free-living assemblages during transit, thereby influencing surrounding microbial diversity and function. Our results challenge the paradigm that phytoplankton from the shallow photic zone are the primary contributor to the vertical flux. We suggest that photoautotrophic prokaryotes from the deep photic zone contribute significantly to deep-water carbon in this environment, and possibly in other oxygen-deficient waters with sulfidic photic zones. Furthermore, results suggest that seasonally variable terrestrial carbon and metal inputs also influence microbial diversity and function in similar systems."				40724	8	archive	39	disk0/00/04/07/24	9/29/22 21:10	9/29/22 21:10	9/29/22 21:10	article	show	39	BOSC 2022: the first hybrid and 23rd annual Bioinformatics Open Source Conference	pub	1/1/22	published	10.12688/f1000research.125043.1	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36128559	36128559	public	F1000Research	1034	FALSE	2046-1402	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40724	"The 23 rd annual Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC 2022) was part of this year's conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB).

BRAF inhibitors, used as therapy in patients with these mutations, often lead to tumour resistance and, thus, the use of MEK inhibitors was introduced in clinics. BRAFi/MEKi, a combination that has modestly increased overall survival in patients, has been proven to differentially affect immune ligands, such as NKG2D-ligands, in drug-sensitive vs. drug-resistant cells. However, the fact that NKG2D-ligands can be released as soluble molecules or in extracellular vesicles represents an additional level of complexity that has not been explored. Here we demonstrate that inhibition of MAPK using MEKi, and the combination of BRAFi with MEKi in vitro, modulates NKG2D-ligands in BRAF-mutant and WT melanoma cells, together with other NK activating ligands. These observations reinforce a role of the immune system in the generation of resistance to directed therapies and support the potential benefit of MAPK inhibition in combination with immunotherapies. Both soluble and EV-associated NKG2D-ligands, generally decreased in BRAF-mutant melanoma cell supernatants after MAPKi in vitro, replicating cell surface expression. Because potential NKG2D-ligand fluctuation during MAPKi treatment could have different consequences for the immune response, a pilot study to measure NKG2D-ligand variation in plasma or serum from metastatic melanoma patients, at different time points during MAPKi treatment, was performed. Not all NKG2D-ligands were equally detected. Further, EV detection did not parallel soluble protein. Altogether, our data confirm the heterogeneity between melanoma lesions, and suggest testing several NKG2D-ligands and other melanoma antigens in serum, both as soluble or vesicle-released proteins, to help classifying immune competence of patients."	10		PMC9884675	40682	6	archive	39	disk0/00/04/06/82	7/21/22 21:53	7/21/22 21:53	7/21/22 21:53	article	show	39	Dimethyl Fumarate Blocks Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha-Driven Inflammation and Metabolic Rewiring in the Retinal Pigment Epithelium	pub	1/1/22	published	10.3389/fnmol.2022.896786	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35813071	35813071	public	Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience	896786	TRUE	1662-5099	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40682	"The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) acts as a metabolic gatekeeper between photoreceptors and the choroidal vasculature to maintain retinal function. RPE dysfunction is a key feature of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of blindness in developed countries. Inflammation is a key pathogenic mechanism in AMD and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) has been implicated as a pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in AMD. While mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in AMD pathogenesis, the interplay between inflammation and cellular metabolism remains elusive. The present study explores how the pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNFα, impacts mitochondrial morphology and metabolic function in RPE. Matured human primary RPE (H-RPE) were treated with TNFα (10 ng/ml) for up to 5 days. TNFα-induced upregulation of IL-6 secretion and inflammatory genes (IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1) was accompanied by increased oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and reduced glycolysis, leading to an increase in cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed defects in mitochondrial morphology with engorged mitochondria and loss of cristae integrity following TNFα treatment. Pre-treatment with the anti-inflammatory drug, 80 μM dimethyl fumarate (DMFu), blocked TNFα-induced inflammatory activation of RPE (IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, CFH, CFB, C3) and normalized their bioenergetic profile to control levels by regulating PFKFB3 and PKM2 gene expression. Furthermore, DMFu prevented TNFα-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and morphological anomalies. Thus, our results indicate that DMFu serves as a novel therapeutic avenue for combating inflammatory activation and metabolic dysfunction of RPE in AMD."	15		PMC9259930	40836	7	archive	39	disk0/00/04/08/36	2/6/23 21:26	2/6/23 21:26	2/6/23 21:26	article	show	39	Ten new high-quality genome assemblies for diverse bioenergy sorghum genotypes	pub	1/1/22	published	10.3389/fpls.2022.1040909	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36684744	36684744	public	Frontiers in Plant Science	1040909	TRUE	1664-462X	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40836	"INTRODUCTION: Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) is an agriculturally and economically important staple crop that has immense potential as a bioenergy feedstock due to its relatively high productivity on marginal lands. To capitalize on and further improve sorghum as a potential source of sustainable biofuel, it is essential to understand the genomic mechanisms underlying complex traits related to yield, composition, and environmental adaptations. METHODS: Expanding on a recently developed mapping population, we generated de novo genome assemblies for 10 parental genotypes from this population and identified a comprehensive set of over 24 thousand large structural variants (SVs) and over 10.5 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). RESULTS: We show that SVs and nonsynonymous SNPs are enriched in different gene categories, emphasizing the need for long read sequencing in crop species to identify novel variation. Furthermore, we highlight SVs and SNPs occurring in genes and pathways with known associations to critical bioenergy-related phenotypes and characterize the landscape of genetic differences between sweet and cellulosic genotypes. DISCUSSION: These resources can be integrated into both ongoing and future mapping and trait discovery for sorghum and its myriad uses including food, feed, bioenergy, and increasingly as a carbon dioxide removal mechanism."	13		PMC9846640	40493	9	archive	39	disk0/00/04/04/93	1/20/22 15:34	1/20/22 15:34	1/20/22 15:34	article	show	39	SciApps: An Automated Platform for Processing and Distribution of Plant Genomics Data	pub	1/1/22	published	10.1007/978-1-0716-2067-0_10	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35037207	35037207	none	Methods in Molecular Biology	197-209	TRUE	1064-3745	https://repository.cshl.edu/id/eprint/40493	"SciApps is an open-source, web-based platform for processing, storing, visualizing, and distributing genomic data and analysis results.

Datasets may need to be managed over long periods of time. Reliable and secure repositories are needed for data storage. Sharing big data requires advance planning and becomes complex when collaborators are spread across institutions and countries. Many complex analyses require the larger compute resources only provided by cloud and high-performance computing infrastructure. Finally at publication, funder and publisher requirements must be met for data availability and accessibility and computational reproducibility. For all of these reasons, cloud-based cyberinfrastructures are an important component for satisfying the needs of data-intensive research. Learning how to incorporate these technologies into your research skill set will allow you to work with data analysis challenges that are often beyond the resources of individual research institutions. One of the advantages of CyVerse is that there are many solutions for high-powered analyses that do not require knowledge of command line (i.e., Linux) computing. In this chapter we will highlight CyVerse capabilities by analyzing RNA-Seq data. The lessons learned will translate to doing RNA-Seq in other computing environments and will focus on how CyVerse infrastructure supports reproducibility goals (e.g., metadata management, containers), team science (e.g., data sharing features), and flexible computing environments (e.g., interactive computing, scaling)."	2443
