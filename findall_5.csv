Interfering with metastatic spread is therefore important for achieving better survival from cancer. Metastatic disease is established through a series of steps, including breaching of the basement membrane, intravasation and survival in lymphatic or blood vessels, extravasation, and growth at distant sites. Yet, although we know the steps involved in metastasis, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of dissemination and colonization of distant organs are incompletely understood. Here, we review the important insights into the metastatic process that have been gained specifically through the use of imaging technologies in murine, chicken embryo and zebrafish model systems, including high-resolution two-photon microscopy and bioluminescence. We further discuss how imaging technologies are beginning to allow researchers to address the role of regional activation of specific molecular pathways in the metastatic process. These technologies are shedding light, literally, on almost every step of the metastatic process, particularly with regards to the dynamics and plasticity of the disseminating cancer cells and the active participation of the microenvironment in the processes.']",['Not applicable 1'],[]

Here, we performed single-cell profiling of liver stromal cells from mouse models of induced spontaneous liver cancer or implanted colorectal liver metastases, with a focus on tumor endothelial cells (ECs). While ECs in liver tissue adjacent to cancerous lesions (so-called adjacent normal) corresponded to liver zonation phenotypes, their transcriptomes were also clearly altered by the presence of a tumor.

Further, tumor ECs, independent of tumor origin, formed distinct clusters displaying conserved “tip-like” or “stalk-like” characteristics, similar to ECs from subcutaneous tumors. However, they also carried liver-specific signatures found in normal liver ECs, suggesting an influence of the host organ on tumor ECs. Our results document gene expression signatures in ECs in liver cancer and show that the host organ, and not the site of tumor origin (liver versus colorectal), is a primary determinant of EC phenotype.

The relatively low crop yields may be attributed to non-availability of improved cultivars, poor crop husbandry and exposure to a number of biotic and abiotic stresses in pigeonpea growing regions. Narrow genetic diversity in cultivated germplasm has further hampered the effective utilization of conventional breeding as well as development and utilization of genomic tools, resulting in pigeonpea being often referred to as an ‘orphan crop legume’. To enable genomics-assisted breeding in this crop, the pigeonpea genomics initiative (PGI) was initiated in late 2006 with funding from Indian Council of Agricultural Research under the umbrella of Indo-US agricultural knowledge initiative, which was further expanded with financial support from the US National Science Foundation’s Plant Genome Research Program and the Generation Challenge Program. As a result of the PGI, the last 3\xa0years have witnessed significant progress in development of both genetic as well as genomic resources in this crop through effective collaborations and coordination of genomics activities across several institutes and countries. For instance, 25 mapping populations segregating for a number of biotic and abiotic stresses have been developed or are under development. An 11X-genome coverage bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library comprising of 69,120 clones have been developed of which 50,000 clones were end sequenced to generate 87,590 BAC-end sequences (BESs). About 10,000 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from Sanger sequencing and ca. 2\xa0million short ESTs by 454/FLX sequencing have been generated. A variety of molecular markers have been developed from BESs, microsatellite or simple sequence repeat (SSR)-enriched libraries and mining of ESTs and genomic amplicon sequencing. Of about 21,000 SSRs identified, 6,698 SSRs are under analysis along with 670 orthologous genes using a GoldenGate SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) genotyping platform, with large scale SNP discovery using Solexa, a next generation sequencing technology, is in progress. Similarly a diversity array technology array comprising of ca. 15,000 features has been developed. In addition, >600 unique nucleotide binding site (NBS) domain containing members of the NBS-leucine rich repeat disease resistance homologs were cloned in pigeonpea; 960 BACs containing these sequences were identified by filter hybridization, BES physical maps developed using high information content fingerprinting. To enrich the genomic resources further, sequenced soybean genome is being analyzed to establish the anchor points between pigeonpea and soybean genomes. In addition, Solexa sequencing is being used to explore the feasibility of generating whole genome sequence. In summary, the collaborative efforts of several research groups under the umbrella of PGI are making significant progress in improving molecular tools in pigeonpea and should significantly benefit pigeonpea genetics and breeding. As these efforts come to fruition, and expanded (depending on funding), pigeonpea would move from an ‘orphan legume crop’ to one where genomics-assisted breeding approaches for a sustainable crop improvement are routine.']",['Not applicable 12'],[]

However, this process seems to be related to pathways other than transcriptional control.

The authors identify Bootlegger and Nxf3 as novel components of the piRNA precursor processing pathway required for transposon silencing in the fly germline.', 'The PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway is a conserved small RNA-based immune system that protects animal germ cell genomes from the harmful effects of transposon mobilization. In ', ' ovaries, most piRNAs originate from dual-strand clusters, which generate piRNAs from both genomic strands. Dual-strand clusters use noncanonical transcription mechanisms. Although transcribed by RNA polymerase II, cluster transcripts lack splicing signatures and poly(A) tails. mRNA processing is important for general mRNA export mediated by nuclear export factor 1 (Nxf1). Although UAP56, a component of the transcription and export complex, has been implicated in piRNA precursor export, it remains unknown how dual-strand cluster transcripts are specifically targeted for piRNA biogenesis by export from the nucleus to cytoplasmic processing centers. Here we report that dual-strand cluster transcript export requires CG13741/Bootlegger and the ', ' nuclear export factor family protein Nxf3. Bootlegger is specifically recruited to piRNA clusters and in turn brings Nxf3. We found that Nxf3 specifically binds to piRNA precursors and is essential for their export to piRNA biogenesis sites, a process that is critical for germline transposon silencing. Our data shed light on how dual-strand clusters compensate for a lack of canonical features of mature mRNAs to be specifically exported via Nxf3, ensuring proper piRNA production.']",['Sequencing data reported here have been deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE133528).

Although developmental impairments/intellectual disability may be the presenting feature (and in some cases the only finding), many individuals have additional cardiovascular, growth, and dysmorphic findings that vary in type and severity. Therefore, this set of disorders has substantial phenotypic variability and, as such, should be referred to more broadly as ', '-related syndrome. ', ' encodes an enzyme NAA10 that is certainly involved in the amino-terminal acetylation of proteins, alongside other proposed functions for this same protein. The mechanistic basis for how variants in ', ' lead to the various phenotypes in humans is an active area of investigation, some of which will be reviewed herein.', 'A detailed overview of a rare X-linked hereditary disorder gives clinicians a resource for making an informed diagnosis based on genetic data and developmental abnormalities. Around 80% of all human proteins are modified on their amino terminus via tagging with an acetyl group, and the NAA10 enzyme plays a major role in this process. Mutations in the gene encoding NAA10 produce severe neurological and cardiovascular effects. Yiyang Wu and Gholson Lyon at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Woodbury, USA, have reviewed current research to facilitate accurate identification of ‘', '-related syndrome’. Since this gene resides on the X chromosome, mutations strongly affect males, although some female carriers also show symptoms.

We present a series of statistical summaries and plots to evaluate the performance in terms of specificity and sensitivity, available as a R/Bioconductor package (', '). Using two independent datasets, we assessed seven competing pipelines. Performance was generally poor, with two methods clearly underperforming and RSEM slightly outperforming the rest.']","['A key aspect of our proposed assessment is the availability of two datasets that permit the computation of the metrics. They are characterized by including two populations, at least two replicates for each population, and a way to define beforehand which genes or transcripts are differentially expressed and which are not. The replicates permit the assessment of precision and comparing the two populations permits the assessment of sensitivity or the ability to discover real biological differences. Note that sensitivity is harder to assess because we need to know beforehand what differences to expect. In the past, this has been achieved with spike-in experiments [18–20]. However, the use of spike-ins has been criticized for not properly mimicking real experimental data [21].The first represents the minimal dataset that can be used for the comparison. It includes two replicates for the cell lines GM12878 and K562. We used results from a microarray experiment comparing the same two cell lines to define real biological differences. We defined genes with a q-value smaller than 0.05 [22, 23] and absolute log fold changes larger than 1 as truly differentially expressed. Genes with q-values larger than 0.5 were denoted as not differentially expressed. Genes in neither of these two groups were considered to be in a “grey area” and left out of the analysis. Note that we are not considering microarrays to be a gold standard, but because the microarray data represents an independent measurement, algorithms that perform better at detecting real differences should, on average, show improved agreement with these independent results.The second dataset was created using 30 samples from the Geuvadis project [24]. These samples were selected to represent a random sample of individuals. To introduce batch effect-like variability, we selected 15 from one center and 15 from another. These were then randomly divided into two groups both having seven samples from one center and eight from another. Because the samples were assigned at random, this is a null experiment and we can consider the 15 samples in each group to be replicates. To distinguish the two groups, we used computer simulations to generate 2424 transcripts designed to be differentially expressed between the two groups. To make these abundances mimic experimental data, we adapted the Polyester method [25] to include GC bias imitating the bias observed in the actual data. The resulting dataset mimics a real one quite well (Fig.\xa01).Fig. 1Estimated log fold changes stratified by transcript abundance on simulation dataset. One example based on Cufflinks quantification of two samples is shown here. Black points are non-differential transcripts; blue points are differentially expressed transcripts which were simulated to have signals on both samples; red points are differentially expressed transcripts which were simulated to have signals in only one of the samplesThe raw sequencing files for both datasets are available from the webtool (http://rafalab.rc.fas.harvard.edu/rnaseqbenchmark).

We measured meristem height, width, plastochron internode length, and associated traits from 86 individuals of the intermated B73 × Mo17 recombinant inbred line population.

In contrast, B73 and Mo17 were similar in meristem width traits and plastochron internode length, with transgressive segregation in the population. Multiple loci (6−9 for each trait) were mapped, indicating meristem architecture is controlled by many regions; none of these coincided with previously described mutants impacting meristem development.

Their findings show that in the absence of RNF17, the ping-pong cycle is derepressed, and secondary meiotic piRNA production is suppressed. Loss of RNF17 and derepression of the ping-pong cycle also result in the down-regulation of considerable numbers of genes that harbor transposon content in their UTRs, resulting in sterility. Overall, this study provides novel insights into the regulation of the ping-pong cycle and the role of Rnf17 during male germ cell development.', 'PIWI proteins and their associated piRNAs protect germ cells from the activity of mobile genetic elements. Two classes of piRNAs—primary and secondary—are defined by their mechanisms of biogenesis. Primary piRNAs are processed directly from transcripts of piRNA cluster loci, whereas secondary piRNAs are generated in an adaptive amplification loop, termed the ping-pong cycle. In mammals, piRNA populations are dynamic, shifting as male germ cells develop. Embryonic piRNAs consist of both primary and secondary species and are mainly directed toward transposons. In meiotic cells, the piRNA population is transposon-poor and largely restricted to primary piRNAs derived from pachytene piRNA clusters. The transition from the embryonic to the adult piRNA pathway is not well understood. Here we show that RNF17 shapes adult meiotic piRNA content by suppressing the production of secondary piRNAs. In the absence of RNF17, ping-pong occurs inappropriately in meiotic cells. Ping-pong initiates piRNA responses against not only transposons but also protein-coding genes and long noncoding RNAs, including genes essential for germ cell development.

Automethylated EZH2/PRC2 exhibits a higher level of histone methyltransferase activity and is required for attaining proper cellular levels of H3K27me3. While occurring independently of PRC2 recruitment to chromatin, automethylation promotes PRC2 accessibility to the histone H3 tail. Intriguingly, EZH2 automethylation is significantly reduced in diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) cells that carry a lysine-to-methionine substitution in histone H3 (H3K27M), but not in cells that carry either EZH2 or EED mutants that abrogate PRC2 allosteric activation, indicating that H3K27M impairs the intrinsic activity of PRC2.

Applying this model to the sperm methylomes, we uncovered an overall evolutionary expansion of the hypomethylated fraction of the genome, driven both by the birth of new hypomethylated regions and by extensive widening of hypomethylated intervals in ancestral species. This expansion shows strong lineage-specific aspects, most notably that hypomethylated intervals around transcription start sites have evolved to be considerably wider in primates and dog than in rodents, whereas rodents show evidence of a greater trend toward birth of new hypomethylated regions. Lineage-specific hypomethylated regions are enriched near sets of genes with common developmental functions and significant overlap across lineages. Rodent-specific and primate-specific hypomethylated regions are enriched for binding sites of similar transcription factors, suggesting that the plasticity accommodated by certain regulatory factors is conserved, despite substantial change in the specific sites of regulation.

The establishment of the first Critical Assessment of Functional Annotation (CAFA) was aimed at increasing progress in the field. We present an independent analysis of the results of CAFA, aimed at identifying challenges in assessment and at understanding trends in prediction performance. We found that well-accepted methods based on sequence similarity (i.e., BLAST) have a dominant effect. Many of the most informative predictions turned out to be either recovering existing knowledge about sequence similarity or were ""post-dictions"" already documented in the literature. These results indicate that deep challenges remain in even defining the task of function assignment, with a particular difficulty posed by the problem of defining function in a way that is not dependent on either flawed gold standards or the input data itself. In particular, we suggest that using the Gene Ontology (or other similar systematizations of function) as a gold standard is unlikely to be the way forward.']",['Not applicable 107'],[]

Ovarian cancer patients tend to present with advanced disease, which also limits treatment options; consequently, new therapies are required. The oncoprotein tyrosine kinase MET, which is the receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), has been implicated in ovarian tumorigenesis and has been the subject of extensive drug development efforts. Here, we report a novel ligand- and autophosphorylation-independent activation of MET through the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase feline sarcoma-related (FER). We demonstrated that the levels of FER were elevated in ovarian cancer cell lines relative to those in immortalized normal surface epithelial cells and that suppression of FER attenuated the motility and invasive properties of these cancer cells. Furthermore, loss of FER impaired the metastasis of ovarian cancer cells in vivo. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that FER phosphorylated a signaling site in MET: Tyr1349. This enhanced activation of RAC1/PAK1 and promoted a kinase-independent scaffolding function that led to recruitment and phosphorylation of GAB1 and the specific activation of the SHP2–ERK signaling pathway.

Conserved sequence features corresponding to iHMR transcript start sites, including a discernible TATA motif, suggest a conserved, functional role for transcription in these regions. Similarly, we explored both primate-specific and human population variation at iHMRs, finding that while enhancer iHMRs are more variable in sequence and methylation status than any other functional class, conservation of the TATA box is highly predictive of iHMR maintenance, reflecting the impact of sequence plasticity and transcriptional signals on iHMR establishment.

Recent findings suggest that chromatin structure participates in its regulation. Here, we analyze the RNA from subcellular fractions obtained through RNA-seq in the cell line K562. We show that in the human genome, splicing occurs predominantly during transcription. We introduce the coSI measure, based on RNA-seq reads mapping to exon junctions and borders, to assess the degree of splicing completion around internal exons. We show that, as expected, splicing is almost fully completed in cytosolic polyA+ RNA. In chromatin-associated RNA (which includes the RNA that is being transcribed), for 5.6% of exons, the removal of the surrounding introns is fully completed, compared with 0.3% of exons for which no intron-removal has occurred. The remaining exons exist as a mixture of spliced and fewer unspliced molecules, with a median coSI of 0.75. Thus, most RNAs undergo splicing while being transcribed: “co-transcriptional splicing.” Consistent with co-transcriptional spliceosome assembly and splicing, we have found significant enrichment of spliceosomal snRNAs in chromatin-associated RNA compared with other cellular RNA fractions and other nonspliceosomal snRNAs. CoSI scores decrease along the gene, pointing to a “first transcribed, first spliced” rule, yet more downstream exons carry other characteristics, favoring rapid, co-transcriptional intron removal. Exons with low coSI values, that is, in the process of being spliced, are enriched with chromatin marks, consistent with a role for chromatin in splicing during transcription.

Transgenerationally inherited piRNAs trigger piRNA biogenesis in the progeny by two different mechanisms. First, inherited piRNAs guide post-transcriptional processing of precursors into mature piRNAs. Second, inherited piRNAs direct the modification of the chromatin state of cluster sequences. This study provides key insights into the transgenerational mechanism that specifies piRNA biogenesis in the germline.', 'Small noncoding RNAs that associate with Piwi proteins, called piRNAs, serve as guides for repression of diverse transposable elements in germ cells of metazoa.

We found that transgenerationally inherited piRNAs provide the critical trigger for piRNA production from homologous genomic regions in the next generation by two different mechanisms. First, inherited piRNAs enhance processing of homologous transcripts into mature piRNAs by initiating the ping-pong cycle in the cytoplasm. Second, inherited piRNAs induce installment of the histone 3 Lys9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) mark on genomic piRNA cluster sequences. The heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) homolog Rhino binds to the H3K9me3 mark through its chromodomain and is enriched over piRNA clusters. Rhino recruits the piRNA biogenesis factor Cutoff to piRNA clusters and is required for efficient transcription of piRNA precursors.

These “inflorescences” arise from stem cell populations in shoot meristems that mature gradually to reproductive states in response to environmental and endogenous signals. The morphology of the shoot meristem maturation process is conserved across distantly related plants, raising the question of how diverse inflorescence architectures arise from seemingly common maturation programs. In tomato and related nightshades (Solanaceae), inflorescences range from solitary flowers to highly branched structures bearing hundreds of flowers. Since reproductive barriers between even closely related Solanaceae have precluded a genetic dissection, we captured and compared meristem maturation transcriptomes from five domesticated and wild species reflecting the evolutionary continuum of inflorescence complexity. We find these divergent species share hundreds of dynamically expressed genes, enriched for transcription factors. Meristem stages are defined by distinct molecular states and point to modified maturation schedules underlying architectural variation. These modified schedules are marked by a peak of transcriptome expression divergence during the reproductive transition, driven by heterochronic shifts of dynamic genes, including transcriptional regulators with known roles in flowering. Thus, evolutionary diversity in Solanaceae inflorescence complexity is determined by subtle modifications of transcriptional programs during a critical transitional window of meristem maturation, which we propose underlies similar cases of plant architectural variation. More broadly, our findings parallel the recently described transcriptome “inverse hourglass” model for animal embryogenesis, suggesting both plant and animal morphological variation is guided by a mid-development period of transcriptome divergence.']","['Raw data from this study have been submitted to the Sol Genomics Network ftp site (ftp://ftp.solgenomics.net) and the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) under accession number SRP090200.

Here, we present and analyze the most complete human lncRNA annotation to date, produced by the GENCODE consortium within the framework of the ENCODE project and comprising 9277 manually annotated genes producing 14,880 transcripts. Our analyses indicate that lncRNAs are generated through pathways similar to that of protein-coding genes, with similar histone-modification profiles, splicing signals, and exon/intron lengths. In contrast to protein-coding genes, however, lncRNAs display a striking bias toward two-exon transcripts, they are predominantly localized in the chromatin and nucleus, and a fraction appear to be preferentially processed into small RNAs. They are under stronger selective pressure than neutrally evolving sequences—particularly in their promoter regions, which display levels of selection comparable to protein-coding genes. Importantly, about one-third seem to have arisen within the primate lineage. Comprehensive analysis of their expression in multiple human organs and brain regions shows that lncRNAs are generally lower expressed than protein-coding genes, and display more tissue-specific expression patterns, with a large fraction of tissue-specific lncRNAs expressed in the brain. Expression correlation analysis indicates that lncRNAs show particularly striking positive correlation with the expression of antisense coding genes.

Celastrol is known to elicit a cellular stress response resembling the response to heat shock, but the transcriptional basis of this response remains unclear. Our analysis of PRO-seq data for K562 cells reveals dramatic transcriptional effects soon after celastrol treatment at a broad collection of both coding and noncoding transcription units. This transcriptional response occurred in two major waves, one within 10 min, and a second 40–60 min after treatment. Transcriptional activity was generally repressed by celastrol, but one distinct group of genes, enriched for roles in the heat shock response, displayed strong activation. Using a regression approach, we identified key transcription factors that appear to drive these transcriptional responses, including members of the E2F and RFX families. We also found sequence-based evidence that particular transcription factors drive the activation of enhancers. We observed increased polymerase pausing at both genes and enhancers, suggesting that pause release may be widely inhibited during the celastrol response.

Mcm4, a helicase subunit, possesses an unstructured regulatory domain that mediates control from multiple kinase signaling pathways, including the Dbf4-dependent Cdc7 kinase (DDK). Following replication stress in S phase, Dbf4 and Sld3, an initiation factor and essential target of Cyclin-Dependent Kinase (CDK), are targets of the checkpoint kinase Rad53 for inhibition of initiation from origins that have yet to be activated, so-called late origins. Here, whole-genome DNA replication profile analysis is used to access under various conditions the effect of mutations that alter the Mcm4 regulatory domain and the Rad53 targets, Sld3 and Dbf4. Late origin firing occurs under genotoxic stress when the controls on Mcm4, Sld3, and Dbf4 are simultaneously eliminated.

Depletion of SRSF1 compromises the association of splicing factors to nuclear speckles and influences the levels of other SR proteins. SRSF1 regulates RNA polymerase II–mediated transcription.', 'The mammalian cell nucleus is compartmentalized into nonmembranous subnuclear domains that regulate key nuclear functions. Nuclear speckles are subnuclear domains that contain pre-mRNA processing factors and noncoding RNAs. Many of the nuclear speckle constituents work in concert to coordinate multiple steps of gene expression, including transcription, pre-mRNA processing and mRNA transport. The mechanism that regulates the formation and maintenance of nuclear speckles in the interphase nucleus is poorly understood. In the present study, we provide evidence for the involvement of nuclear speckle resident proteins and RNA components in the organization of nuclear speckles. SR-family splicing factors and their binding partner, long noncoding metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 RNA, can nucleate the assembly of nuclear speckles in the interphase nucleus. Depletion of SRSF1 in human cells compromises the association of splicing factors to nuclear speckles and influences the levels and activity of other SR proteins. Furthermore, on a stably integrated reporter gene locus, we demonstrate the role of SRSF1 in RNA polymerase II–mediated transcription.

They show that SRSF2 Pro95 hot spot mutations elicit enhanced mRNA decay, which is dependent on sequence-specific RNA binding and splicing, and thus provide new insight into the critical effects of SRSF2 mutants in hematologic malignancies.', 'Oncogenic mutations in the RNA splicing factors SRSF2, SF3B1, and U2AF1 are the most frequent class of mutations in myelodysplastic syndromes and are also common in clonal hematopoiesis, acute myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and a variety of solid tumors. They cause genome-wide splicing alterations that affect important regulators of hematopoiesis. Several mRNA isoforms promoted by the various splicing factor mutants comprise a premature termination codon (PTC) and are therefore potential targets of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). In light of the mechanistic relationship between splicing and NMD, we sought evidence for a specific role of mutant SRSF2 in NMD. We show that SRSF2 Pro95 hot spot mutations elicit enhanced mRNA decay, which is dependent on sequence-specific RNA binding and splicing. SRSF2 mutants enhance the deposition of exon junction complexes (EJCs) downstream from the PTC through RNA-mediated molecular interactions. This architecture then favors the association of key NMD factors to elicit mRNA decay. Gene-specific blocking of EJC deposition by antisense oligonucleotides circumvents aberrant NMD promoted by mutant SRSF2, restoring the expression of PTC-containing transcript. Our study uncovered critical effects of SRSF2 mutants in hematologic malignancies, reflecting the regulation at multiple levels of RNA metabolism, from splicing to decay.']",['Not applicable 203'],[]

We recently developed a version of open microfluidics suitable for live-cell biology in which the aqueous phase is confined by an interface with an immiscible and bioinert fluorocarbon (FC40). Here, we find that common medium additives (fetal bovine serum, serum replacement) induce elastic no-slip boundaries at this interface and develop a semi-analytical model to predict flow fields.

However, the payload capacity of <4.9\u2009kb limits the transfer of large or multiple genes. Oversized payloads could be delivered by fragmenting the transgenes into separate AAV capsids that are then mixed. This strategy could increase the AAV cargo capacity to treat monogenic, polygenic diseases and comorbidities only if controlled co-expression of multiple AAV capsids is achieved on each transduced cell. We developed a tool to quantify the number of incoming AAV genomes that are co-expressed in the nervous system with single-cell resolution. By using an isogenic mix of three AAVs each expressing single fluorescent reporters, we determined that expression of much greater than 31 AAV genomes per neuron in vitro and 20 genomes per neuron in vivo is obtained across different brain regions including anterior cingulate, prefrontal, somatomotor and somatosensory cortex areas, and cerebellar lobule VI. Our results demonstrate that multiple AAV vectors containing different transgenes or transgene fragments, can efficiently co-express in the same neuron.

One prediction of this “primacy coding” scheme is that decisions based on odor identity can be made solely using early odor-evoked neural activity. Using an optogenetic masking paradigm, we define the sensory integration time necessary for odor identification and demonstrate that animals can use information occurring <100\u2009ms after inhalation onset to identify odors.

Although metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of many cancers, including PDA, previous attempts to target metabolic changes therapeutically have been stymied by drug toxicity and tumour cell plasticity. Here, we show that PDA cells engage an eIF4F-dependent translation program that supports redox and central carbon metabolism. Inhibition of the eIF4F subunit, eIF4A, using the synthetic rocaglate CR-1-31-B (CR-31) reduced the viability of PDA organoids relative to their normal counterparts. In vivo, CR-31 suppresses tumour growth and extends survival of genetically-engineered murine models of PDA. Surprisingly, inhibition of eIF4A also induces glutamine reductive carboxylation. As a consequence, combined targeting of eIF4A and glutaminase activity more effectively inhibits PDA cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. Overall, our work demonstrates the importance of eIF4A in translational control of pancreatic tumour metabolism and as a therapeutic target against PDA.', 'Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA).

Neutrophils release histone-bound nuclear DNA and cytotoxic granules as extracellular traps (NET). Here we show that CAFs induce NET formation within the tumor and systemically in the blood and bone marrow. These tumor-induced NETs (t-NETs) are driven by a ROS-mediated pathway dependent on CAF-derived Amyloid β, a peptide implicated in both neurodegenerative and inflammatory disorders. Inhibition of NETosis in murine tumors skews neutrophils to an anti-tumor phenotype, preventing tumor growth; reciprocally, t-NETs enhance CAF activation. Mirroring observations in mice, CAFs are detected juxtaposed to NETs in human melanoma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and show elevated amyloid and β-Secretase expression which correlates with poor prognosis. In summary, we report that CAFs drive NETosis to support cancer progression, identifying Amyloid β as the protagonist and potential therapeutic target.', 'The tumor microenvironment is composed of many cell types that crosstalk to modulate local immunity.

Inferring Langevin equations from data can reveal how transient dynamics of such systems give rise to their function. However, dynamics are often inaccessible directly and can be only gleaned through a stochastic observation process, which makes the inference challenging. Here we present a non-parametric framework for inferring the Langevin equation, which explicitly models the stochastic observation process and non-stationary latent dynamics. The framework accounts for the non-equilibrium initial and final states of the observed system and for the possibility that the system’s dynamics define the duration of observations. Omitting any of these non-stationary components results in incorrect inference, in which erroneous features arise in the dynamics due to non-stationary data distribution. We illustrate the framework using models of neural dynamics underlying decision making in the brain.', 'Langevin dynamics describe transient behavior of many complex systems, however, inferring Langevin equations from noisy data is challenging.

We developed statistical techniques (fractal dimension differences and a box-counting method ‘occupancy’) to analyze the spatial distribution of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Our results indicate that B cells in good outcome tumors (no recurrence within 5 years) are spatially dispersed, while B cells in poor outcome tumors (recurrence within 3 years) are more confined. While most TILs are located within the stroma, increased numbers of spatially dispersed lymphocytes within cancer cell islands are associated with a good prognosis. B cells and T cells often form lymphocyte clusters (LCs) identified via density-based clustering. LCs consist either of T cells only or heterotypic mixtures of B and T cells. Pure B cell LCs were negligible in number. Compared to tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), LCs have fewer lymphocytes at lower densities. Both types of LCs are more abundant and more spatially dispersed in good outcomes compared to poor outcome tumors. Heterotypic LCs in good outcome tumors are smaller and more numerous compared to poor outcome. Heterotypic LCs are also closer to cancer islands in a good outcome, with LC size decreasing as they get closer to cancer cell islands.

Here, we investigate blood-based DNA methylation in a large family where a balanced translocation between chromosomes 1 and 11 shows genome-wide significant linkage to psychiatric illness. Genome-wide DNA methylation was profiled in whole-blood-derived DNA from 41 individuals using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). We found significant differences in DNA methylation when translocation carriers (', '\u2009=\u200917) were compared to related non-carriers (', '\u2009=\u200924) at 13 loci. All but one of the 13 significant differentially methylated positions (DMPs) mapped to the regions surrounding the translocation breakpoints. Methylation levels of five DMPs were associated with genotype at SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with the translocation. Two of the five genes harbouring significant DMPs, ', ' and ', ', have been previously shown to be differentially methylated in schizophrenia. Gene Ontology analysis revealed enrichment for terms relating to neuronal function and neurodevelopment among the genes harbouring the most significant DMPs. Differentially methylated region (DMR) analysis highlighted a number of genes from the MHC region, which has been implicated in psychiatric illness previously through genetic studies. We show that inheritance of a translocation linked to major mental illness is associated with differential DNA methylation at loci implicated in neuronal development/function and in psychiatric illness. As genomic rearrangements are over-represented in individuals with psychiatric illness, such analyses may be valuable more widely in the study of these conditions.', 'Kathryn Evans and colleagues at the University of Edinburgh, UK, analysed the DNA of 41 members of a family that includes 17 people with major mental illness (schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and other conditions) associated with the translocation of genetic material between chromosomes 1 and 11. The analyses showed differences between translocation carriers and non-carriers in the levels of methyl groups attached to their DNA in the regions of the genome surrounding the translocation, and elsewhere in genes associated with the immune system and with nervous system development and function. Further work is needed to confirm if and investigate how these differences in DNA methylation are related to psychiatric illness.']",['The code used in this analysis (including version information) can be accessed by contacting the corresponding author.'],[]

The genomic distribution profiles, primary binding motifs, chromatin states, and DNA methylation preferences are well conserved for TF-occupied sequences. However, the extent to which orthologous DNA segments are bound by orthologous TFs varies both among TFs and with genomic location: binding at promoters is more highly conserved than binding at distal elements.

We describe the generation of the PCAWG resource, facilitated by international data sharing using compute clouds. On average, cancer genomes contained 4–5\xa0driver mutations when combining coding and non-coding genomic elements; however, in around 5% of cases no drivers were identified, suggesting that cancer driver discovery is not yet complete. Chromothripsis, in which many clustered structural variants arise in a single catastrophic event, is frequently an early event in tumour evolution; in acral melanoma, for example, these events precede most somatic point mutations and affect several cancer-associated genes simultaneously. Cancers with abnormal telomere maintenance often originate from tissues with low replicative activity and show several mechanisms of preventing telomere attrition to critical levels. Common and rare germline variants affect patterns of somatic mutation, including point mutations, structural variants and somatic retrotransposition.

Here, using high-throughput transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling of more than 450,000 single nuclei in humans, marmoset monkeys and mice, we demonstrate a broadly conserved cellular makeup of this region, with similarities that mirror evolutionary distance and are consistent between the transcriptome and epigenome. The core conserved molecular identities of neuronal and non-neuronal cell types allow us to generate a cross-species consensus classification of cell types, and to infer conserved properties of cell types across species. Despite the overall conservation, however, many species-dependent specializations are apparent, including differences in cell-type proportions, gene expression, DNA methylation and chromatin state. Few cell-type marker genes are conserved across species, revealing a short list of candidate genes and regulatory mechanisms that are responsible for conserved features of homologous cell types, such as the GABAergic chandelier cells. This consensus transcriptomic classification allows us to use patch–seq (a combination of whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, RNA sequencing and morphological characterization) to identify corticospinal Betz cells from layer 5 in non-human primates and humans, and to characterize their highly specialized physiology and anatomy.

We fully reconstructed 1,741 neurons from cortex, claustrum, thalamus, striatum and other brain regions in mice.

Overall, our study demonstrates the crucial need for quantitative description of complete single-cell anatomy in cell-type classification, as single-cell morphological diversity reveals a plethora of ways in which\xa0different cell types and their individual members may contribute to the configuration and function of their respective circuits.', 'Sparse labelling and whole-brain imaging are used to reconstruct and\xa0classify brain-wide complete\xa0morphologies of 1,741 individual neurons in the mouse brain, revealing a dependence on both brain region and transcriptomic profile.']","['Vaa3D (version 3.604), TeraFly (version 2.5.101) and TeraVR (version bundled with Vaa3D) are available at the Vaa3D github, https://github.com/Vaa3D, with both source code and binary executable.

Additionally, development of these tools in squirrel monkeys, a well-established model system for several human neurological diseases, can aid in identifying novel treatment strategies.']",['The datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.'],[]

Notably, altering the flow of sensory events through omission of the cued texture touch elicited large responses in a subset of neurons hardly responsive to or even inhibited by the tactile stimuli. Hence, PPC neurons were able to discriminate not only tactile stimulus features (i.e., texture graininess) but also between the presence and omission of the texture stimulus. Whereas some of the neurons responsive to texture omission were driven by looming-like auditory sounds others became recruited only with tactile sensory experience. These findings indicate that layer 2/3 neuronal populations in PPC potentially encode correlates of expectancy in addition to auditory and tactile stimuli.']",['All relevant datasets are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.'],[]

Links between branches, however, can be ephemeral, easily destroyed by wind, rain, or animal movements. Here we report a biologically feasible distributed algorithm, parameterized using field data, that can plausibly describe how turtle ants maintain the routing backbone and find alternative paths to circumvent broken links in the backbone. We validate the ability of this probabilistic algorithm to circumvent simulated breaks in synthetic and real-world networks, and we derive an analytic explanation for why certain features are crucial to improve the algorithm’s success.

Through an integrative analytic pipeline, we showed that tumors from patients who achieved a durable clinical response displayed a permissive microenvironment, substantiated by the upregulation of transcripts encoding for molecules involved in leukocyte adhesion and migration, cytotoxic functions, and antigen presentation. In responding patients, Imiquimod triggered a strong T-helper-1 (Th-1)/cytotoxic immune response, characterized by the coordinated upregulation of Th-1 chemokines, migration of Th-1 and cytotoxic T cells into the tumor, and activation of immune-effector functions, ultimately mediating tumor destruction. In conclusion, we have shown that topical imiquimod can induce a robust immune response in breast cancer metastases, and this response is more likely to occur in tumors with a pre-activated microenvironment.

Within a few hours, a selective reduction in the number of neuronal activity-dependent transcripts occurred with relative preservation of housekeeping genes commonly used as a reference for RNA normalization. Gene clustering indicated a rapid reduction in neuronal gene expression with a reciprocal time-dependent increase in astroglial and microglial gene expression that continued to increase for at least 24\xa0h after tissue resection.

Using RNA-seq, we directly compare TDP-43-mediated RNA processing in muscle (C2C12) and neuronal (NSC34) mouse cells. TDP-43 displays a cell-type-characteristic behaviour targeting unique transcripts in each cell-type, which is due to characteristic expression of RNA-binding proteins, that influence TDP-43’s performance and define cell-type specific splicing. Among splicing events commonly dysregulated in both cell lines, we identify some that are TDP-43-dependent also in human cells. Inclusion levels of these alternative exons are altered in tissues of patients suffering from FTLD and IBM. We therefore propose that TDP-43 dysfunction contributes to disease development either in a common or a tissue-specific manner.', 'The aetiology of the TDP-43 aggregation manifest itself in the muscle and neuronal cells.

This model was challenged by the finding that the peripheral representation of the primary visual cortex (V1) receives monosynaptic connections from areas of the auditory cortex in the macaque. However, auditory projections to V1 have not been reported in other primates. We investigated the existence of direct interconnections between V1 and auditory areas in the marmoset, a New World monkey. Labelled neurons in auditory cortex were observed following 4 out of 10 retrograde tracer injections involving V1. These projections to V1 originated in the caudal subdivisions of auditory cortex (primary auditory cortex, caudal belt and parabelt areas), and targeted parts of V1 that represent parafoveal and peripheral vision. Injections near the representation of the vertical meridian of the visual field labelled few or no cells in auditory cortex. We also placed 8 retrograde tracer injections involving core, belt and parabelt auditory areas, none of which revealed direct projections from V1. These results confirm the existence of a direct, nonreciprocal projection from auditory areas to V1 in a different primate species, which has evolved separately from the macaque for over 30\xa0million years.

Using an immune-competent liver cancer model in which senescence triggers CD8 T cell–mediated tumor rejection, we show that senescence also remodels the cell-surface proteome to alter how tumor cells sense environmental factors, as exemplified by type II interferon (IFNγ). Compared with proliferating cells, senescent cells upregulate the IFNγ receptor, become hypersensitized to microenvironmental IFNγ, and more robustly induce the antigen-presenting machinery—effects also recapitulated in human tumor cells undergoing therapy-induced senescence.

The pervasive sex-biased expression of miRNAs generally increases with the complexity and sexual dimorphism of tissues, gonads revealing the most striking biases. We find that the male-specific regulation of the X chromosome is relevant to miRNA expression on two levels. First, in the male gonad, testis-biased miRNAs tend to reside on the X chromosome. Second, in the soma, X-linked miRNAs do not systematically rely on dosage compensation. We set out to address the importance of a sex-biased expression of miRNAs in establishing sexually dimorphic traits. Our study of the conserved let-7-C miRNA cluster controlled by the sex-biased hormone ecdysone places let-7 as a primary modulator of the sex-determination hierarchy. Flies with modified let-7 levels present doublesex-related phenotypes and express sex-determination genes normally restricted to the opposite sex. In testes and ovaries, alterations of the ecdysone-induced let-7 result in aberrant gonadal somatic cell behavior and non-cell-autonomous defects in early germline differentiation. Gonadal defects as well as aberrant expression of sex-determination genes persist in aging adults under hormonal control. Together, our findings place ecdysone and let-7 as modulators of a somatic systemic signal that helps establish and sustain sexual identity in males and females and differentiation in gonads.

In maize (', '), leaves are formed throughout vegetative development; on transition to floral development, the shoot meristem forms the tassel. Due to the regulated balance between stem cell maintenance and organogenesis, the structure and morphology of the shoot meristem are constrained during vegetative development. Previous work identified loci controlling meristem architecture in a recombinant inbred line population. The study presented here expanded on this by investigating shoot apical meristem morphology across a diverse set of maize inbred lines. Crosses of these lines to common parents showed varying phenotypic expression in the F1, with some form of heterosis occasionally observed. An investigation of meristematic growth throughout vegetative development in diverse lines linked the timing of reproductive transition to flowering time. Phenotypic correlations of meristem morphology with adult plant traits showed an association between the meristem and flowering time, leaf shape, and yield traits, revealing links between the control and architecture of undifferentiated and differentiated plant organs. Finally, quantitative trait loci mapping was utilized to map the genetic architecture of these meristem traits in two divergent populations. Control of meristem architecture was mainly population-specific, with 15 total unique loci mapped across the two populations with only one locus identified in both populations.']","['All raw data as well as means used for analyses can be found in the maize SAM diversity raw data and means spreadsheet (Table S5, Table S6, Table S7, Table S8, Table S9, Table S10, Table S11, Table S12, Table S13, and Table S14).']","['http://www.g3journal.org/content/suppl/2015/03/05/g3.115.017541.DC1/TableS5.xlsx', 'http://www.g3journal.org/content/suppl/2015/03/05/g3.115.017541.DC1/TableS6.xlsx', 'http://www.g3journal.org/content/suppl/2015/03/05/g3.115.017541.DC1/TableS7.xlsx', 'http://www.g3journal.org/content/suppl/2015/03/05/g3.115.017541.DC1/TableS8.xlsx', 'http://www.g3journal.org/content/suppl/2015/03/05/g3.115.017541.DC1/TableS9.xlsx', 'http://www.g3journal.org/content/suppl/2015/03/05/g3.115.017541.DC1/TableS10.xlsx', 'http://www.g3journal.org/content/suppl/2015/03/05/g3.115.017541.DC1/TableS11.xlsx', 'http://www.g3journal.org/content/suppl/2015/03/05/g3.115.017541.DC1/TableS12.xlsx', 'http://www.g3journal.org/content/suppl/2015/03/05/g3.115.017541.DC1/TableS13.xlsx', 'http://www.g3journal.org/content/suppl/2015/03/05/g3.115.017541.DC1/TableS14.xlsx']"

The subset of individuals selected should ensure that the captured genetic diversity is fully representative and includes variants across all subpopulations. For example, human variation has historically focused on individuals with European ancestry, but this represents a small fraction of the overall diversity. Addressing this, SVCollector identifies the optimal subset of individuals for resequencing by analyzing population-level VCF files from low-resolution genotyping studies. It then computes a ranked list of samples that maximizes the total number of variants present within a subset of a given size. To solve this optimization problem, SVCollector implements a fast, greedy heuristic and an exact algorithm using integer linear programming. We apply SVCollector on simulated data, 2504 human genomes from the 1000 Genomes Project, and 3024 genomes from the 3000 Rice Genomes Project and show the rankings it computes are more representative than alternative naive strategies. When selecting an optimal subset of 100 samples in these cohorts, SVCollector identifies individuals from every subpopulation, whereas naive methods yield an unbalanced selection. Finally, we show the number of variants present in cohorts selected using this approach follows a power-law distribution that is naturally related to the population genetic concept of the allele frequency spectrum, allowing us to estimate the diversity present with increasing numbers of samples.']",['The SVCollector source code is available at GitHub (https://github.com/fritzsedlazeck/SVCollector) and as Supplemental Code.'],['http://genome.cshlp.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1101/gr.264879.120/-/DC1']

Evolutionarily young genes were likely to be generated in reproductive tissues and usually had fewer isoforms than old genes. We also observed similarities and differences in alternative splicing patterns and activities, both among tissues and between species. The maize subgenomes exhibited no bias in isoform generation; however, genes in the B genome were more highly expressed in pollen tissue, whereas genes in the A genome were more highly expressed in endosperm.

The strong fluorogenic behaviour, high selectivity, and excellent stability of Apotracker Red make it a reliable optical reporter for the characterisation of the effects of anticancer drugs in cells in\u2005vitro and for direct imaging of chemotherapy‐induced apoptosis in\u2005vivo in mouse models of breast cancer.', 'We describe Apotracker Red as a single fluorescent activatable probe for robust quantification of cancer cell death in fluorescence‐based assays and in\u2005vivo using multiphoton intravital imaging in mouse models of breast cancer.', '\n']",['Not applicable 352'],[]

Understanding the regulation of Nrf2 activity and downstream pathways has major implications for human health.', ' Nrf2 regulates the transcription of components of the glutathione and thioredoxin antioxidant systems, as well as enzymes involved in phase I and phase II detoxification of exogenous and endogenous products, NADPH regeneration, and heme metabolism. It therefore represents a crucial regulator of the cellular defense mechanisms against xenobiotic and oxidative stress. In addition to antioxidant responses, Nrf2 is involved in other cellular processes, such as autophagy, intermediary metabolism, stem cell quiescence, and unfolded protein response. Given the wide range of processes that Nrf2 controls, its activity is tightly regulated at multiple levels. Here, we review the different modes of regulation of Nrf2 activity and the current knowledge of Nrf2-mediated transcriptional control.', ' It is now clear that Nrf2 lies at the center of a complex regulatory network. A full comprehension of the Nrf2 program will require an integrated consideration of all the different factors determining Nrf2 activity.', ' Additional computational and experimental studies are needed to obtain a more dynamic global view of Nrf2-mediated gene regulation. In particular, studies comparing how the Nrf2-dependent network changes from a physiological to a pathological condition can provide insight into mechanisms of disease and instruct new treatment strategies.']",['Not applicable 353'],[]

In this article, we describe the development of a quantitative trait loci (QTL) database and illustrate how it can be used to facilitate both the forward and reverse genetics research. The QTL database contains the largest online collection of rice QTL data in the world. Using flanking markers as anchors, QTLs originally reported on individual genetic maps have been systematically aligned to the rice sequence where they can be searched as standard genomic features. Researchers can determine whether a QTL co-localizes with other QTLs detected in independent experiments and can combine data from multiple studies to improve the resolution of a QTL position. Candidate genes falling within a QTL interval can be identified and their relationship to particular phenotypes can be inferred based on functional annotations provided by ontology terms. Mutations identified in functional genomics populations and association mapping panels can be aligned with QTL regions to facilitate fine mapping and validation of gene–phenotype associations. By assembling and integrating diverse types of data and information across species and levels of biological complexity, the QTL database enhances the potential to understand and utilize QTL information in biological research.']",['Not applicable 354'],[]

The coherent investigation of genic and genomic data often requires comparative genomics analyses based on whole-genome alignments, sets of homologous genes and other relevant datasets in order to evaluate and answer evolutionary-related questions. However, the complexity and computational requirements of producing such data are substantial: this has led to only a small number of reference resources that are used for most comparative analyses. The Ensembl comparative genomics resources are one such reference set that facilitates comprehensive and reproducible analysis of chordate genome data. Ensembl computes pairwise and multiple whole-genome alignments from which large-scale synteny, per-base conservation scores and constrained elements are obtained. Gene alignments are used to define Ensembl Protein Families, GeneTrees and homologies for both protein-coding and non-coding RNA genes. These resources are updated frequently and have a consistent informatics infrastructure and data presentation across all supported species. Specialized web-based visualizations are also available including synteny displays, collapsible gene tree plots, a gene family locator and different alignment views. The Ensembl comparative genomics infrastructure is extensively reused for the analysis of non-vertebrate species by other projects including Ensembl Genomes and Gramene and much of the information here is relevant to these projects. The consistency of the annotation across species and the focus on vertebrates makes Ensembl an ideal system to perform and support vertebrate comparative genomic analyses.

We further show that the three representative baseline methods used to generate recommended articles for evaluation (Okapi Best Matching 25, Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency and PubMed Related Articles) had similar overall performances. Additionally, we found that these methods each tend to produce distinct collections of recommended articles, suggesting that a hybrid method may be required to completely capture all relevant articles.

Axonal arbors from populations of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in the D2 column were labeled by lentivirus-mediated expression of green fluorescent protein. Axonal projection patterns were compared between untrimmed control animals and animals with all whiskers in A-, B-, and C-rows trimmed (D- and E-rows left intact) from postnatal days 7 to 15 (termed from here on DE-pairing). Control animals had approximately symmetrical horizontal projections toward C- and E-row columns in both supra- and infragranular layers. Following DE-pairing, the density of axons in supragranular layers projecting from the labeled neurons in the D2 column was higher in E- than in C-row columns. This asymmetry resulted primarily from a reduction in projection density toward the deprived C-row columns. In contrast, no change was observed in infragranular layers. The results indicate that DE-pairing during early postnatal development results in reduced axonal projection from nondeprived into deprived columns and that cortical neurons are capable of structural rearrangements at subsets of their axonal arbors.']",['Not applicable 363'],[]

MK-STYX is catalytically inactive due to the absence of two amino acids from the signature motif that are essential for phosphatase activity. The nucleophilic cysteine residue and the adjacent histidine residue, which are conserved in all active dual-specificity phosphatases, are replaced by serine and phenylalanine residues respectively in MK-STYX. Mutations to introduce histidine and cysteine residues into the active site of MK-STYX generated an active phosphatase. Using MS, we identified G3BP1 [Ras-GAP (GTPase-activating protein) SH3 (Src homology 3) domain-binding protein-1], a regulator of Ras signalling, as a binding partner of MK-STYX. We observed that G3BP1 bound to native MK-STYX; however, binding to the mutant catalytically active form of MK-STYX was dramatically reduced. G3BP1 is also an RNA-binding protein with endoribonuclease activity that is recruited to ‘stress granules’ after stress stimuli. Stress granules are large subcellular structures that serve as sites of mRNA sorting, in which untranslated mRNAs accumulate. We have shown that expression of MK-STYX inhibited stress granule formation induced either by aresenite or expression of G3BP itself; however, the catalytically active mutant MK-STYX was impaired in its ability to inhibit G3BP-induced stress granule assembly. These results reveal a novel facet of the function of a member of the PTP family, illustrating a role for MK-STYX in regulating the ability of G3BP1 to integrate changes in growth-factor stimulation and environmental stress with the regulation of protein synthesis.']",['Not applicable 365'],[]

', ', the lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN, through which it dephosphorylates the 3 position in the inositol sugar of phosphatidylinositol derivatives, is important for its tumour suppressor function; however, the significance of its protein phosphatase activity remains unclear. Using two-photon laser-scanning microscopy and biolistic gene delivery of GFP (green fluorescent protein)-tagged constructs into organotypic hippocampal slice cultures, we have developed an assay of PTEN function in living tissue. Using this bioassay, we have demonstrated that overexpression of wild-type PTEN led to a decrease in spine density in neurons. Furthermore, it was the protein phosphatase activity, but not the lipid phosphatase activity, of PTEN that was essential for this effect. The ability of PTEN to decrease neuronal spine density depended upon the phosphorylation status of serine and threonine residues in its C-terminal segment and the integrity of the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif. The present study reveals a new aspect of the function of this important tumour suppressor and suggest that, in addition to dephosphorylating the 3 position in phosphatidylinositol phospholipids, the critical protein substrate of PTEN may be PTEN itself.']",['Not applicable 366'],[]

The role of hyaluronan synthases 2 and 3 (HAS2, 3) was investigated in pancreatic cancer growth and the tumor microenvironment. Overexpression of HAS3 increased hyaluronan synthesis in BxPC-3 pancreatic cancer cells. In vivo, overexpression of HAS3 led to faster growing xenograft tumors with abundant extracellular hyaluronan accumulation. Treatment with pegylated human recombinant hyaluronidase (PEGPH20) removed extracellular hyaluronan and dramatically decreased the growth rate of BxPC-3 HAS3 tumors compared to parental tumors. PEGPH20 had a weaker effect on HAS2-overexpressing tumors which grew more slowly and contained both extracellular and intracellular hyaluronan. Accumulation of hyaluronan was associated with loss of plasma membrane E-cadherin and accumulation of cytoplasmic ', '-catenin, suggesting disruption of adherens junctions. PEGPH20 decreased the amount of nuclear hypoxia-related proteins and induced translocation of E-cadherin and ', '-catenin to the plasma membrane. Translocation of E-cadherin was also seen in tumors from a transgenic mouse model of pancreatic cancer and in a human non-small cell lung cancer sample from a patient treated with PEGPH20. In conclusion, hyaluronan accumulation by HAS3 favors pancreatic cancer growth, at least in part by decreasing epithelial cell adhesion, and PEGPH20 inhibits these changes and suppresses tumor growth.']",['Not applicable 372'],[]

Here, we present the Genome Mappability Score (GMS) as a novel measure of the complexity of resequencing a genome.

These errors are fundamental to the mapping process and cannot be overcome by increasing coverage.

Both standardized expression values and SNVs appear to be equally capable of reconstructing a similar pattern of phylogenetic relationship.

The procedure results in a series of spatial transformations that are applied to the coordinates of labeled neurons in the different cases, bringing them into common stereotaxic space. We applied this procedure to 17 injections, placed in the frontal lobe of nine marmosets as part of earlier studies. Visualizations of cortical patterns of connections revealed by these injections are supplied as Supplementary Materials. Comparison between the results of the automated and human‐based processing of these cases reveals that the centers of injection sites can be reconstructed, on average, to within 0.6\u2009mm of coordinates estimated by an experienced neuroanatomist. Moreover, cell counts obtained in different areas by the automated approach are highly correlated (', '\u2009=\u20090.83) with those obtained by an expert, who examined in detail histological sections for each individual.

The patterns of CNVs across individuals were surprisingly simple at the kilo-base scale, suggesting the applicability of a simple genetic analysis for these genetic loci. We utilized the probabilistic theory to determine integer copy numbers of CNVs and employed a recently developed phasing tool to estimate the population frequencies of integer copy number alleles and CNV–SNP haplotypes. The results showed a tendency toward a lower frequency of CNV alleles and that most of our CNVs were explained only by zero-, one- and two-copy alleles. Using the estimated population frequencies, we found several CNV regions with exceptionally high population differentiation. Investigation of CNV–SNP linkage disequilibrium (LD) for 500–900 bi- and multi-allelic CNVs per population revealed that previous conflicting reports on bi-allelic LD were unexpectedly consistent and explained by an LD increase correlated with deletion-allele frequencies. Typically, the bi-allelic LD was lower than SNP–SNP LD, whereas the multi-allelic LD was somewhat stronger than the bi-allelic LD.

We develop the hypothesis that emotions are the product of neural computations whose motor role is to reallocate bodily resources mostly gated by smooth muscles. This “emotor” control system is analagous to the more familiar motor control computations that coordinate skeletal muscle movements. To illustrate this framework, we review recent research on “confidence.” Although familiar as a feeling, confidence is also an objective statistical quantity: an estimate of the probability that a hypothesis is correct. This model-based approach helped reveal the neural basis of decision confidence in mammals and provides a bridge to the subjective feeling of confidence in humans. These results have important implications for psychiatry, since disorders of confidence computations appear to contribute to a number of psychopathologies.

This simultaneous representation of different elements of a task is called a ‘mixed’ representation, and is difficult to analyse.', 'Kobak, Brendel et al. have now developed a data analysis tool that can ‘demix’ neural activity. The tool breaks down the activity of a population of neurons into its individual components. Each of these relates to only a single aspect of the task and is thus easier to interpret. Information about stimuli, for example, is distinguished from information about the animal’s confidence levels.', 'Kobak, Brendel et al. used the demixing tool to reanalyse existing datasets recorded from several different animals, tasks and brain regions.

However, sole reliance on this measure includes the de facto assumption that any locomotor activity reflects an absence of fear. Consequently, alternative expressions of associative learning are rarely considered. Here we identify a novel, active fear response (‘darting’) that occurs primarily in female rats. In females, darting exhibits the characteristics of a learned fear behavior, appearing during the CS period as conditioning proceeds and disappearing from the CS period during extinction. This finding motivates a reinterpretation of rodent fear conditioning studies, particularly in females, and it suggests that conditioned fear behavior is more diverse than previously appreciated. Moreover, rats that darted during initial fear conditioning exhibited lower freezing during the second day of extinction testing, suggesting that females employ distinct and adaptive fear response strategies that improve long-term outcomes.', '\n', 'Animals can respond to fear in a variety of ways, such as by standing still (freezing), or rapidly escaping from an apparent threat. Freezing is the most common measure of fear that has been used in research studies. However, since the vast majority of these experiments have used male animals, it is not clear if freezing is a sufficient measure of fear in females.', 'To address this question, Gruene et al. analyzed different types of fear responses in large groups of male and female rats. The experiments used a technique called cued fear conditioning, which pairs a sound with a mild electrical shock to a foot. When rats learn that the sound predicts the shock, the sound alone causes them to produce a fear response. However, if the sound is then played repeatedly without a footshock, the rats learn to become less fearful of the sound in another learning process called “extinction”.', 'The experiments found that females were four times more likely than males to display fear in the form of rapid movements (referred to as “darting”). Animals that displayed darting were also less likely to freeze in response to the sound cue, which suggests that darting may represent an alternative fear strategy that is more common in females. During a subsequent extinction test, females that darted also displayed quicker reductions in both types of fear responses, which suggests that darting might be an active coping response that promotes long term reductions in fear.', 'Gruene et al.’s findings suggest that there are differences in the ways that males and females respond in fear of a threatening stimulus, and highlight the importance of analyzing a variety of fear responses in experiments. The next steps will be to understand the biological basis of the darting response in female rats.', '\n']",['Not applicable 414'],[]

This decision involves delaying expression of Cyclin E that promotes DNA replication. ORC1, the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) large subunit, is inherited into newly born cells after it binds to condensing chromosomes during the preceding mitosis. We demonstrate that ORC1 represses Cyclin E gene (', ') transcription, an E2F1 activated gene that is also repressed by the Retinoblastoma (RB) protein. ORC1 binds to RB, the histone methyltransferase SUV39H1 and to its repressive histone H3K9me3 mark. ORC1 cooperates with SUV39H1 and RB protein to repress E2F1-dependent ', ' transcription. In contrast, the ORC1-related replication protein CDC6 binds Cyclin E-CDK2 kinase and in a feedback loop removes RB from ORC1, thereby hyper-activating ', ' transcription. The opposing effects of ORC1 and CDC6 in controlling the level of Cyclin E ensures genome stability and a mechanism for linking directly DNA replication and cell division commitment.', '\n', 'Living cells must replicate their DNA before they divide so that the newly formed cells can each receive an identical copy of the genetic material. Before DNA replication can begin, a number of proteins must come together to form so-called pre-replicative complexes at many locations along the DNA molecules. These protein complexes then serve as landing pads for many other DNA replication proteins.', 'One component of the pre-replicative complex, a protein called ORC1, helps to recruit another protein called CDC6 that in turn acts with Cyclin E to promote the replication of the DNA. Cyclin E is a protein that is only expressed when cells commit to divide. Previous research has shown that a lack of ORC1 causes the levels of Cyclin E to rise in human cells, but it was not understood how cells regulate the levels of Cyclin E.', 'Now, Hossain and Stillman show that the ORC1 protein switches off the gene that encodes Cyclin E early on in newly born cells, and therefore prevents the Cyclin E protein from being produced. The experiments show that ORC1 does this by binding near one end of the gene for Cyclin E and interacting with two other proteins to inactivate the gene. Thus, ORC1 establishes a period when Cyclin E is absent from a newly formed cell. This essentially gives the cell time to ‘decide’ (based on external cues and its own signaling) whether it will divide again or enter into a non-dividing state.', 'When a cell does decide to divide, the levels of CDC6 rise. CDC6 is another component of the pre-replicative complex and Hossain and Stillman find that CDC6 works to counteract the effects of ORC1 and reactivate the gene for Cyclin E. This activity leads to a dramatic increase in the production of Cyclin E, which in turn allows the cells to commit to another round of DNA replication and division.', 'The opposing effects of ORC1 and CDC6 control the levels of Cyclin E and provide a link between DNA replication and a cell’s decision to divide.

We identified two types of visual projection neurons (VPNs) directly connecting the optic lobes and the vAC.

The segregation of visual and olfactory domains in the MB allows independent processing of distinct sensory memories and may be a conserved form of sensory representations among insects.', '\n']",['Not applicable 416'],[]

To understand the contribution of the transcription machinery in the disassembly of the +1 H2A.Z nucleosome, conditional mutants were used to block PIC assembly. A quantitative ChIP-seq approach, which allows detection of global occupancy change, was employed to measure H2A.Z occupancy. Blocking PIC assembly resulted in promoter-specific H2A.Z accumulation, indicating that the PIC is required to evict H2A.Z. By contrast, H2A.Z eviction was unaffected upon depletion of INO80, a remodeler previously reported to displace nucleosomal H2A.Z. Robust PIC-dependent H2A.Z eviction was observed at active and infrequently transcribed genes, indicating that constitutive H2A.Z turnover is a general phenomenon. Finally, sites with strong H2A.Z turnover precisely mark transcript starts, providing a new metric for identifying cryptic and alternative sites of initiation.', '\n', 'To fit the genetic information of an animal, yeast or other eukaryote into cells, DNA is tightly wound around proteins called histones to form repeating units known as nucleosomes. However, this tight winding prevents proteins from accessing the DNA, and so prevents gene transcription – the first stage of producing the molecules encoded by a gene. For transcription to take place, nucleosomes at DNA sequences called promoters must be reorganized and disassembled, thereby allowing proteins to bind to and engage these sequences and to turn nearby genes on.', 'H2A is a histone protein that is found in the majority of nucleosomes in yeast cells. A different form of this histone – called H2A.Z – is found in nucleosomes near the promoter of almost every gene. It is thought that nucleosomes that contain H2A.Z are recognized and disassembled as the gene turns on, but it is unclear how this happens.', 'To investigate how H2A.Z nucleosomes are disassembled, Tramantano et al. depleted yeast cells of various proteins thought to play a role in the disassembly process. This indicated that the proteins that transcribe genes play crucial roles in the process of disassembling the H2A.Z nucleosomes, because H2A.Z accumulated at promoters in cells that are depleted of these proteins.', 'Further investigation revealed that disassembled H2A.Z nucleosomes are reassembled with H2A histones, before being converted back to the H2A.Z form by an enzyme called SWR1. This turnover of H2A.Z was seen at active genes and those that are infrequently transcribed, suggesting that it is a general phenomenon.', 'Tramantano et al. also found that the turnover rate of H2A.Z can be used to accurately predict the sites in the DNA where transcription starts. This observation could therefore help to identify previously unknown transcription start sites. Future work could address further questions about how H2A.Z nucleosomes are disassembled. For example, what is the mechanical force that drives this process?

Among the best described sub-population of cancer cells generated by non-genetic mechanisms are cells characterized by a CD44+/CD24− cell surface marker profile. Here, we report that human CD44+/CD24− cancer cells are genetically highly unstable because of intrinsic defects in their DNA-repair capabilities. In fact, in CD44+/CD24− cells, constitutive activation of the TGF-beta axis was both necessary and sufficient to reduce the expression of genes that are crucial in coordinating DNA damage repair mechanisms. Consequently, we observed that cancer cells that reside in a CD44+/CD24− state are characterized by increased accumulation of DNA copy number alterations, greater genetic diversity and improved adaptability to drug treatment. Together, these data suggest that the transition into a CD44+/CD24− cell state can promote intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity, spur tumor evolution and increase tumor fitness.', '\n', 'A single tumor can be made up of thousands of cancer cells that look and behave differently from one another. This observed diversity arises from changes in the DNA sequence of particular genes, changes in the activity of genes, and the ability of cells to transition between different states. As a result, individual cells within a tumor may react differently to certain anti-cancer drugs: most of the cells may be sensitive to the treatment and die, whereas some might be resistant and survive.', 'Previous studies on several types of human cancers – including breast, brain and lung cancers – have identified a group of cells called CD44+/CD24- cells that seem to be more aggressive and resistant to therapy than other cancer cells. However, it is currently not known exactly how these CD44+/CD24- cells influence a whole tumor’s resistance to anti-cancer drugs.', 'Certain cancer cells in tumors are exposed to a signal molecule called TGF-β. CD44+/CD24- cells are unusual in that they are able to produce and release this signal molecule themselves. Pal et al. show that in CD44+/CD24- cells from a human lung cancer cell line, TGF-β decreased the activity of genes responsible for accurately fixing breaks in the CD44+/CD24- cells’ DNA. As a result, these cells made more mistakes than other lung cancer cells when repairing damaged DNA and consequently accumulated additional genetic mutations. Furthermore, tumors containing these cells were more likely to survive treatment with chemotherapy.', 'The findings of Pal et al. show that the CD44+/CD24- cells exposed to TGF-β had a survival advantage because they were more genetically diverse and therefore better able to adapt to new drug treatments and other changes in their surroundings.

Here we describe a new experimental approach, called Tite-Seq, that is capable of measuring binding titration curves and corresponding affinities for thousands of variant antibodies in parallel. The measurement of titration curves eliminates the confounding effects of antibody expression and stability that arise in standard deep mutational scanning assays. We demonstrate Tite-Seq on the CDR1H and CDR3H regions of a well-studied scFv antibody. Our data shed light on the structural basis for antigen binding affinity and suggests a role for secondary CDR loops in establishing antibody stability. Tite-Seq fills a large gap in the ability to measure critical aspects of the adaptive immune system, and can be readily used for studying sequence-affinity landscapes in other protein systems.', '\n', 'Antibodies are proteins produced by cells of the immune system to tag or neutralize potential threats to the body, such as foreign substances and disease-causing microbes. Antibodies do this by binding to target molecules called antigens. An antibody’s ability to bind to an antigen depends on the sequence of amino acids – the building blocks of proteins – that make up the antibody. Through a process that randomizes this sequence of amino acids, the immune system generates a vast pool of antibodies that are able to target almost any foreign antigen that exists in nature.', 'Currently, little is understood about how the sequence of amino acids in an antibody determines how strongly that antibody binds to its antigen target – a property referred to as the antibody’s binding affinity. Answering this fundamental question requires techniques that can measure the affinities of many different antibodies at the same time. However, previous high-throughput methods have been unable to provide quantitative measurements of binding affinities. These kinds of measurements are difficult because an antibody’s amino acid sequence governs more than just binding affinity: it also affects how easy it is to produce that antibody, and what fraction of antibody molecules work properly.', 'Adams et al. now describe a new method, named “Tite-Seq”, that overcomes these issues. First, thousands of different antibodies are displayed on the surface of yeast cells, with each cell carrying a single kind of antibody. These cells are then incubated with fluorescently labeled antigen at a wide range of different concentrations. Next, the yeast cells are sorted based on how brightly they glow; brighter cells have more antigen bound to them, and so it is possible to calculate how much of the antigen is bound to each kind of antibody at each concentration. Plotting these data provides a “binding curve” for each antibody, which is then used to read off the antibody’s binding affinity in a way that is not affected by the factors that have plagued other high-throughput methods.', 'Tite-Seq is thus able to measure the binding affinities for thousands of different antibodies at the same time. This will potentially allow researchers to address many fundamental and yet unanswered questions about how the immune system works. Tite-Seq can also be used to measure how amino acid sequence affects the binding affinity of proteins other than antibodies.', '\n']","['The following dataset was generated:\nAdams RM,\nKinney JB,\nMora T,\nWalczak AM,\n2016,Saccharomyces cerevisiae high-throughput titration curves,\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/344711,\nPublicly available at the NCBI BioProject database (accession no: PRJNA344711)\n']",['https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/344711']

In fact, pharmaceutical companies had developed a drug to block the activity of MELK, and this drug is currently being tested in human patients. However, Lin, Giuliano et al. have now taken a second look at the role of MELK in breast cancer, and have come to a different conclusion.', 'Using a gene editing technology called CRISPR/Cas9, Lin, Giuliano et al. removed MELK activity from several cancer cell lines.

Since the drug works when MELK is not present in the cell, the drug must be binding to other proteins.

CLV signaling involves the secretion of the CLV3 peptide and its perception by a number of Leucine-Rich-Repeat (LRR) receptors, including the receptor-like kinase CLV1 and the receptor-like protein CLV2 coupled with the CORYNE (CRN) pseudokinase. CLV2, and its maize ortholog FASCIATED EAR2 (FEA2) appear to function in signaling by CLV3 and several related CLV3/EMBRYO-SURROUNDING REGION (CLE) peptide ligands. Nevertheless, how signaling specificity is achieved remains unknown. Here we show that FEA2 transmits signaling from two distinct CLE peptides, the maize CLV3 ortholog ZmCLE7 and ZmFON2-LIKE CLE PROTEIN1 (ZmFCP1) through two different candidate downstream effectors, the alpha subunit of the maize heterotrimeric G protein COMPACT PLANT2 (CT2), and ZmCRN. Our data provide a novel framework to understand how diverse signaling peptides can activate different downstream pathways through common receptor proteins.', 'Like animals, plants are made up of many different types of cells, which descend from undifferentiated cells called stem cells. Thanks to these cells, plants are able to grow and develop throughout their lives. Stem cells live at the tips of the plant’s shoots and roots. They constantly divide to produce new cells to self-renew or replace specific plant cells in need of repair. Over time, they change – or differentiate – to go on to become part of tissues like leaves, roots, stems, shoots, flowers or fruits.', 'To maintain a continuous pool of undifferentiated stem cells and to make sure that stem cells divide at the correct pace, neighbouring cells emit signals that control the activity of stem cells. The new stem cells that remain close to these ‘maintenance signals’ continue to behave like stem cells, but those displaced away begin to differentiate. Stem cells can receive many different types of signals, but how are these signals filtered and passed onto different places within the cell?', 'To test this, Je, Xu et al. created maize plants that contained mutations in a number of known signalling molecules to see if these molecules used the same communication pathway. The results showed that stem cells could integrate the different signals. Even if the signals pass through the same receiver (a receptor protein called FASCIATED EAR2), each signal exits the receptor as a different message, and attaches to a different messenger protein to relay specific information about stem cell maintenance to the cell.', 'A next step will be to test if other plants use the same signalling pathways in the same ways to send messages between cells. A better knowledge about stem cell signals in plants could help to develop more productive crops. Previous work has found that precise control of stem cell pathways can help breed crops with more seeds or bigger fruits. These kinds of changes have been selected naturally by humans since the dawn of civilization, but we need to accelerate these advances to help meet the needs of the growing world population and improve agricultural sustainability.']",['Not applicable 430'],[]

Progress in medical research and healthcare is hindered by the difficulty in understanding precisely which neurons are active at any given time. New brain imaging techniques and genetic tools allow researchers to track the activity of thousands of neurons in living animals over many months. However, these experiments produce large volumes of data that researchers currently have to analyze manually, which can take a long time and generate irreproducible results.', 'There is a need to develop new computational tools to analyze such data. The new tools should be able to operate on standard computers rather than just specialist equipment as this would limit the use of the solutions to particularly well-funded research teams. Ideally, the tools should also be able to operate in real-time as several experimental and therapeutic scenarios, like the control of robotic limbs, require this. To address this need, Giovannucci et al. developed a new software package called CaImAn to analyze brain images on a large scale.', 'Firstly, the team developed algorithms that are suitable to analyze large sets of data on laptops and other standard computing equipment. These algorithms were then adapted to operate online in real-time. To test how well the new software performs against manual analysis by human researchers, Giovannucci et al. asked several trained human annotators to identify active neurons that were round or donut-shaped in several sets of imaging data from mouse brains. Each set of data was independently analyzed by three or four researchers who then discussed any neurons they disagreed on to generate a ‘consensus annotation’. Giovannucci et al. then used CaImAn to analyze the same sets of data and compared the results to the consensus annotations. This demonstrated that CaImAn is nearly as good as human researchers at identifying active neurons in brain images.', 'CaImAn provides a quicker method to analyze large sets of brain imaging data and is currently used by over a hundred laboratories across the world.

To improve our understanding of the molecular alterations that underlie deadly malignancies, we analyzed the genomic profiles of 17,879 tumors from patients with known outcomes. We find that mutations in almost all cancer driver genes contain remarkably little information on patient prognosis. However, CNAs in these same driver genes harbor significant prognostic power. Focal CNAs are associated with worse outcomes than broad alterations, and CNAs in many driver genes remain prognostic when controlling for stage, grade, ', ' status, and total aneuploidy. By performing a meta-analysis across independent patient cohorts, we identify robust prognostic biomarkers in specific cancer types, and we demonstrate that a subset of these alterations also confer specific therapeutic vulnerabilities. In total, our analysis establishes a comprehensive resource for cancer biomarker identification and underscores the importance of gene copy number profiling in assessing clinical risk.', 'Cancers are not created equal: even when the disease affects the same organ, it can run different courses between individuals. For example, amongst people with early-stage bowel cancer who undergo surgery, 60% will go on to live cancer-free but the remaining patients will see the illness come back within a few years. These differences in outcome are still poorly understood, but they may find their roots in the genetic changes present in tumor cells.', 'Comparing the genomes of healthy and cancerous cells can help to understand which genetic modifications makes a cell go ‘rogue’ and start to multiply uncontrollably. Often, this happens because of a mutation, a change in the letters that compose our genetic code. However, looking at genetic differences between cancerous cells from different patients, or different tumors, can shed light on how certain genetic changes make the disease deadlier or more likely to reoccur.', 'Smith and Sheltzer looked into the genomes of 17,879 tumors from patients whose clinical information was also available. The analysis revealed that specific genetic alterations were more common in either deadly or treatable cancers. Most of these changes were not mutations that affected a few DNA letters; instead, they were copy number alterations, whereby large portions of the genetic code are being repeated or deleted. These results suggest that while mutations certainly drive the development of the disease, other changes such as copy number alterations can tell us which cancers will be deadlier. Through this approach, Smith and Sheltzer were also able to identify copy number alterations that were associated with patients responding well to certain drugs.', 'These findings now need to be confirmed on a different set of data.

Reproducibility, however, has been a concern in neuroscience, particularly for measurements of mouse behavior. Here, we show that a standardized task to probe decision-making in mice produces reproducible results across multiple laboratories. We adopted a task for head-fixed mice that assays perceptual and value-based decision making, and we standardized training protocol and experimental hardware, software, and procedures. We trained 140 mice across seven laboratories in three countries, and we collected 5 million mouse choices into a publicly available database. Learning speed was variable across mice and laboratories, but once training was complete there were no significant differences in behavior across laboratories. Mice in different laboratories adopted similar reliance on visual stimuli, on past successes and failures, and on estimates of stimulus prior probability to guide their choices. These results reveal that a complex mouse behavior can be reproduced across multiple laboratories. They establish a standard for reproducible rodent behavior, and provide an unprecedented dataset and open-access tools to study decision-making in mice. More generally, they indicate a path toward achieving reproducibility in neuroscience through collaborative open-science approaches.', 'In science, it is of vital importance that multiple studies corroborate the same result. Researchers therefore need to know all the details of previous experiments in order to implement the procedures as exactly as possible. However, this is becoming a major problem in neuroscience, as animal studies of behavior have proven to be hard to reproduce, and most experiments are never replicated by other laboratories.', 'Mice are increasingly being used to study the neural mechanisms of decision making, taking advantage of the genetic, imaging and physiological tools that are available for mouse brains. Yet, the lack of standardized behavioral assays is leading to inconsistent results between laboratories. This makes it challenging to carry out large-scale collaborations which have led to massive breakthroughs in other fields such as physics and genetics.', 'To help make these studies more reproducible, the International Brain Laboratory (a collaborative research group) et al. developed a standardized approach for investigating decision making in mice that incorporates every step of the process; from the training protocol to the software used to analyze the data. In the experiment, mice were shown images with different contrast and had to indicate, using a steering wheel, whether it appeared on their right or left. The mice then received a drop of sugar water for every correction decision. When the image contrast was high, mice could rely on their vision. However, when the image contrast was very low or zero, they needed to consider the information of previous trials and choose the side that had recently appeared more frequently.', 'This method was used to train 140 mice in seven laboratories from three different countries. The results showed that learning speed was different across mice and laboratories, but once training was complete the mice behaved consistently, relying on visual stimuli or experiences to guide their choices in a similar way.', 'These results show that complex behaviors in mice can be reproduced across multiple laboratories, providing an unprecedented dataset and open-access tools for studying decision making.

These MYB complexes assemble aberrantly with LYL1, E2A, C/EBP family members, LMO2, and SATB1. They are organized convergently in genetically diverse subtypes of AML and are at least in part associated with inappropriate transcription factor co-expression. Peptidomimetic remodeling of oncogenic MYB complexes is accompanied by specific proteolysis and dynamic redistribution of CBP/P300 with alternative transcription factors such as RUNX1 to induce myeloid differentiation and apoptosis. Thus, aberrant assembly and sequestration of MYB:CBP/P300 complexes provide a unifying mechanism of oncogenic gene expression in AML.

Emergence of these activity patterns and functions is believed to be developmentally regulated, but the postnatal time course for neural networks to perform complex computations remains unknown. We investigate the progression of large-scale synaptic and cellular activity patterns across development using high spatiotemporal resolution in vivo electrophysiology in immature mice. We reveal that mature cortical processes emerge rapidly and simultaneously after a discrete but volatile transition period at the beginning of the second postnatal week of rodent development. The transition is characterized by relative neural quiescence, after which spatially distributed, temporally precise, and internally organized activity occurs. We demonstrate a similar developmental trajectory in humans, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that could facilitate a transition in network operation. We hypothesize that this transient quiescent period is a requisite for the subsequent emergence of coordinated cortical networks.', 'It can take several months, or even years, for the brain of a young animal to develop and refine the complex neural networks which underpin cognitive abilities such as memory, planning, and decision making. While the properties that support these functions have been well-documented, less is known about how they emerge during development.', 'Domínguez, Ma, Yu et al. therefore set out to determine when exactly these properties began to take shape in mice, using lightweight nets of electrodes to record brain activity in sleeping newborn pups. The nets were designed to avoid disturbing the animals or damaging their fragile brains.', 'The recordings showed that patterns of brain activity similar to those seen in adults emerged during the first couple of weeks after birth. Just before, however, the brains of the pups went through a brief period of reduced activity: this lull seemed to mark a transition from an immature to a more mature mode of operation. After this pause, neurons in the mouse brains showed coordinated patterns of firing reminiscent of those seen in adults. By monitoring the brains of human babies using scalp sensors, Domínguez, Ma, Yu et al. showed that a similar transition also occurs in infants during their first few months of life, suggesting that brains may mature via a process retained across species.', 'Overall, the relative lull in activity before transition may mark when neural networks gain mature properties; in the future, it could therefore potentially be used to diagnose and monitor individuals with delayed cognitive development.']","['Source data are presented in Figure supplements and uploaded to Dryad.

Agos bind small RNAs (sRNAs) including small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) to form the functional core of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The sRNA is used as a guide to target mRNAs containing either partially or fully complementary sequences, ultimately leading to downregulation of the corresponding proteins. It was previously shown that the kinase CK1α phosphorylates a cluster of residues in the eukaryotic insertion (EI) of Ago, leading to the alleviation of miRNA-mediated repression through an undetermined mechanism. We show that binding of miRNA-loaded human Ago2 to target RNA with complementarity to the seed and 3’ supplementary regions of the miRNA primes the EI for hierarchical phosphorylation by CK1α. The added negative charges electrostatically promote target release, freeing Ago to seek out additional targets once it is dephosphorylated. The high conservation of potential phosphosites in the EI suggests that such a regulatory strategy may be a shared mechanism for regulating miRNA-mediated repression.', 'Proteins are the chemical ‘workhorses’ of the cell: some help maintain a cell’s shape or structure, while others carry out the chemical reactions necessary for life. Organisms therefore need to keep tight control over the production of proteins in their cells, so that the right amount of each protein is made at the right time, in the right place.', 'Instructions for making new proteins are encoded in a type of molecule called messenger RNA. Each messenger RNA contains the instructions for one protein, which are then ‘read’ and carried out by special cellular machinery called ribosomes. The cell can control how much protein it produces by regulating both the levels of different messenger RNA and the amount of protein ribosomes are allowed to make from those instructions.', 'The main way to regulate the levels of messenger RNA is through their transcription from the genome. However, this needs fine tuning. Cells can do this in a highly specific way using molecules called microRNAs. A microRNA works by directing a protein called Argonaute to the messenger RNA that it targets. Once Argonaute arrives, it can call in additional ‘helper proteins’ to shut down, or reduce, protein production from that messenger RNA, or alternatively to break down the messenger RNA altogether.', 'Cells can use an enzyme called CK1α to attach bulky chemical groups onto a specific part of the Argonaute protein, in a reaction termed phosphorylation. The ability to carry out this reaction (and to reverse it) also seems to be important for microRNAs to do their job properly, but why has remained unknown. Bibel et al. wanted to determine what triggers CK1α to phosphorylate Argonaute, and how this affects interactions between microRNAs, Argonaute and their target messenger RNAs.', 'A series of ‘test tube’ experiments looked at the interaction between purified CK1α and Argonaute under different conditions. These demonstrated that CK1α could only carry out its phosphorylation reaction when Argonaute was already interacting with a microRNA and its corresponding messenger RNA. Further measurements revealed that phosphorylation of Argonaute made it detach from the messenger RNA more quickly. This suggests that phosphorylation might be a way to let Argonaute seek out new messenger RNAs after blocking protein production at its first ‘target’.', 'These results shed new light on a fundamental mechanism that cells use to control protein production. Bibel et al. propose that this mechanism may be shared across many different species and could one day help guide the development of new medical therapies based on microRNAs.']","['All raw files and final state data for the HDX-MS experiments have been deposited in the MASSive public repository at massive.ucsd.edu with the dataset number MSV000088648.

Although free energy calculations indicate that D-serine stabilizes the closed GluN2A LBD, its inhibitory behavior suggests that it either does not remain bound long enough or does not generate sufficient force for ion channel gating. We developed a workflow using pathway similarity analysis to identify groups of residues working together to promote binding. These conformation-dependent pathways were not significantly impacted by the presence of N-linked glycans, which act primarily by interacting with the LBD bottom lobe to stabilize the closed LBD.']","['Data Availability: Data for Figs. 1, 2, and 5 (residue contact frequencies) are included with the manuscript in the source data.

Previously, we identified a cortical neuron type, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons, in auditory cortex that is recruited by behavioral reinforcers and mediates disinhibitory control by inhibiting other inhibitory neurons. As the same disinhibitory cortical circuit is present virtually throughout cortex, we wondered whether VIP neurons are likewise recruited by reinforcers throughout cortex. We monitored VIP neural activity in dozens of cortical regions using three-dimensional random access two-photon microscopy and fiber photometry while mice learned an auditory discrimination task. We found that reward and punishment during initial learning produce rapid, cortex-wide activation of most VIP interneurons. This global recruitment mode showed variations in temporal dynamics in individual neurons and across areas. Neither the weak sensory tuning of VIP interneurons in visual cortex nor their arousal state modulation was fully predictive of reinforcer responses.

Overall, our findings describe the comprehensive transcriptome of cells within the follicle cell tumor model at the single-cell resolution and identify a previously unappreciated link between Keap1-Nrf2 signaling and cell plasticity at early tumorigenesis.', 'In the body, most cells exhibit some form of spatial asymmetry: the compartments within the cell are not evenly distributed, thereby allowing the cells to know whether a surface is on the ‘outside’ or the ‘inside’ of a tissue or organ. In the cells of epithelial tissues, which line most of the cavities and the organs in the body, this asymmetry is known as apical-basal polarity. Maintaining apical-basal polarity in epithelial cells is one of the main barriers that stops cancer cells from invading other tissues, which is the first step of metastasis, the process through which cancer cells leave their tissue of our origin and spread to distant locations in the body.', 'In the fruit fly ', ', scientists have engineered cells in several tissues to stop producing the proteins that help establish apical-basal polarity, in an effort to study the earliest steps of tumor formation. Unfortunately, these experiments frequently lead to rampant metastasis, making it difficult to identify the earliest changes that make the tumor cells more likely to become invasive. Therefore, finding a tissue in which loss of apical-basal polarity does not cause aggressive cancer progression is necessary to address this gap in knowledge.', 'The epithelial cell layer lining the ovaries of fruit flies may be such a tissue. When these cells lose their apical-basal polarity, rather than becoming metastatic and spreading to distant organs, they interleave with each other, forming a tumorous growth that only invades into the neighboring compartment. Chatterjee et al. used this system to study individual invasive cells. They wanted to know whether the genes that these cells switch on and off are known to be involved in human cancers, and if so, which of them control the invasive behavior of tumor cells.', 'Chatterjee et al. determined that when cells in the fruit-fly ovary lost their polarity, they turned genes on and off in a pattern similar to that seen both in mammalian cancers and in tumors from other fly tissues. One of the notable changes they observed in the ovarian cells that lost apical-basal polarity was the activation of the Keap1/Nrf2 oxidative-stress signaling pathway, which normally protects cells from damage caused by excessive oxidation. In the ovarian cells, however, the activation of these genes also led to aggressive invasion of the collective tumor cells into the neighboring compartment.', 'Interestingly, this increase in invasiveness was characterized by polarized changes within the cells, specifically in the scaffolding that allows cells to keep their shape and move: the edge of the cells leading the invasion had greater levels of a protein called actin, which enables the cells to protrude into the neighboring compartments.', 'Chatterjee et al. have identified a new mechanism that impacts the migratory behavior of cells.

We found that a decoder trained using ‘forced choices’ (one target viable) was highly reliable when applied to ‘free choices’. However, during free choices internal events formed three categories. Typically, neural activity was consistent with rapid, unwavering choices. Sometimes, though, we observed presumed ‘changes of mind’: the neural state initially reflected one choice before changing to reflect the final choice.

A common feature among most populations of dopamine neurons was the existence of dense ‘clusters’ of inputs within the ventral striatum. However, we found that dopamine neurons projecting to the posterior striatum were outliers, receiving relatively few inputs from the ventral striatum and instead receiving more inputs from the globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, and zona incerta. These results lay a foundation for understanding the input/output structure of the midbrain dopamine circuit and demonstrate that dopamine neurons projecting to the posterior striatum constitute a unique class of dopamine neurons regulated by different inputs.', '\n', 'Most neurons send their messages to recipient neurons by releasing a substance called a ‘neurotransmitter’ that binds to receptors on the target cell.

This suggests that dopamine neurons with different targets might have different roles. To explore this possibility, Menegas et al. classified dopamine neurons in the mouse brain into eight types based on the areas to which they project, and then mapped which neurons send input signals to each type. These inputs are likely to shape the activity of each type (that is, their ‘message’ to the rest of the brain). The mapping revealed that most dopamine neurons do not receive substantial input from the area to which they project (i.e., they do not form ‘closed loops’). Instead, most of their input comes from a common set of brain regions, including a particularly large number of inputs from the ventral striatum.', ""However, Menegas et al. found one exception.

The pattern of neural activity then changes profoundly just before movement onset. We considered the prediction, derived from formal considerations, that the transition from preparation to movement might be accompanied by a large overall change in the neural state that reflects when movement is made rather than which movement is made. Specifically, we examined “components” of the population response: time-varying patterns of activity from which each neuron’s response is approximately composed. Amid the response complexity of individual M1 and PMd neurons, we identified robust response components that were “condition-invariant”: their magnitude and time course were nearly identical regardless of reach direction or path. These condition-invariant response components occupied dimensions orthogonal to those occupied by the “tuned” response components. The largest condition-invariant component was much larger than any of the tuned components; i.e., it explained more of the structure in individual-neuron responses. This condition-invariant response component underwent a rapid change before movement onset. The timing of that change predicted most of the trial-by-trial variance in reaction time. Thus, although individual M1 and PMd neurons essentially always reflected which movement was made, the largest component of the population response reflected movement timing rather than movement type.']",['Not applicable 479'],[]

To probe the synaptic mechanisms that mediate such adaptive behavior, we trained mice on an auditory-motor reversal task, and tracked changes in the strength of corticostriatal synapses associated with the formation of learned associations. Using a ChR2-based electrophysiological assay in acute striatal slices, we measured the strength of these synapses after animals learned to pair auditory stimuli with specific actions. Here, we report that the pattern of synaptic strength initially established by learning remains unchanged even when the task contingencies are reversed. Our findings reveal that synaptic changes associated with the initial acquisition of this task are not erased or overwritten, and that behavioral reversal of learned associations may recruit a separate neural circuit. These results suggest a more complex role of the striatum in regulating flexible behaviors where activity of striatal neurons may vary given the behavioral contexts of specific stimulus-action associations.']",['Not applicable 480'],[]

We present an alternative that allows mice more control over their water intake: free home-cage access to water, made slightly sour by a small amount of citric acid (CA). In a previous study, rats with free access to CA water readily performed a behavioral task for water rewards, although completing fewer trials than under water restriction (', '). We here extend this approach to mice and confirm its robustness across multiple laboratories. Mice reduced their intake of CA water while maintaining healthy weights. Continuous home-cage access to CA water only subtly impacted their willingness to perform a decision-making task, in which they were rewarded with sweetened water. When free CA water was used instead of water restriction only on weekends, learning and decision-making behavior were unaffected.

We and others recently demonstrated that it also serves as an important node in sleep/wake regulation. Specifically, VTA-dopaminergic neuron activation is sufficient to drive wakefulness and necessary for the maintenance of wakefulness. However, the role of VTA-GABAergic neurons in arousal regulation is not fully understood. It is still unclear whether VTA-GABAergic neurons predictably alter their activity across arousal states, what is the nature of interactions between VTA-GABAergic activity and cortical oscillations, and how activity in VTA-GABAergic neurons relates to VTA-dopaminergic neurons in the context of sleep/wake regulation. To address these, we simultaneously recorded population activity from VTA subpopulations and electroencephalography/electromyography (EEG/EMG) signals during spontaneous sleep/wake states and in the presence of salient stimuli in freely-behaving mice. We found that VTA-GABAergic neurons exhibit robust arousal-state-dependent alterations in population activity, with high activity and transients during wakefulness and REM sleep. During wakefulness, population activity of VTA-GABAergic neurons, but not VTA-dopaminergic neurons, was positively correlated with EEG γ power and negatively correlated with θ power. During NREM sleep, population activity in both VTA-GABAergic and VTA-dopaminergic neurons negatively correlated with δ, θ, and σ power bands. Salient stimuli, with both positive and negative valence, activated VTA-GABAergic neurons. Together, our data indicate that VTA-GABAergic neurons, like their dopaminergic counterparts, drastically alter their activity across sleep-wake states. Changes in their activity predicts cortical oscillatory patterns reflected in the EEG, which are distinct from EEG spectra associated with dopaminergic neural activity.']",['Not applicable 482'],[]

Whether this extensive weak repression is biologically relevant is a central issue in the debate on miRNA functionality. In the “small (target) pool” view, weak repression is nonfunctional and should be gradually removed during evolution. However, since the selective advantage of removing individual targets is small, testing this hypothesis is a challenge. We propose a novel approach by using miRNAs we call twin-miRs, which produce two mature products from the hairpin of the same miRNA precursor. Loss of the minor miR partner would affect all its targets and thus could be visible to selection. Since the minor miRs repress all their targets weakly, the “small pool” hypothesis would predict the elimination of twin-miRs over time. Surveying and sequencing 45 small RNA libraries in ', ', we found that nearly 40% of miRNAs produce twin-miRs. The minor forms are expressed in nontrivial abundance and repress their targets weakly. Interestingly, twin-miRs are often evolutionarily old, highly conserved, and comparable to solo-miRs in expression. Since there is no measurable trend toward reduction in target pool size, we conclude that at least some of the weak repression interactions are functional.

Comparing the time-resolved transcriptome response of NGF- or EGF-stimulated PC12 cells over 24 h in combination with protein and phenotype data we inferred a dynamic Boolean model capturing the temporal sequence of protein signaling, transcriptional response and subsequent autocrine feedback.

Both systems produce a fraction of viral particles that can propagate beyond the primary infected neuron. When injected into mouse brain, viruses produced using these DH RNAs produce transgene expression at the injection site, but also elsewhere in the brain. Such ectopic labeling caused recombinant Sindbis viruses to be classified as anterograde viruses with limited retrograde spread, and can complicate the interpretation of neuroanatomical and other experiments.

Here we review the functional properties of cPVins that enable plasticity in the cortex of adult mammals and the influence of cPVins on sensory activity at four spatiotemporal scales. First, cPVins regulate developmental critical periods and adult plasticity through molecular and structural interactions with the extracellular matrix. Second, they activate in precise sequence following feedforward excitation to enforce strict temporal limits in response to the presentation of sensory stimuli. Third, they implement gain control to normalize sensory inputs and compress the dynamic range of output. Fourth, they synchronize broad network activity patterns in response to behavioral events and state changes. Much of the evidence for the contribution of cPVins to plasticity comes from classic models that rely on sensory deprivation methods to probe experience-dependent changes in the brain.

In the current study using cultures of perinatal NPCs from HMGB2', ' and HMGB2', ' mice we discovered that vital elements of the polycomb group (PcG) epigenetic complexes polycomb repressive complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1/2) were downregulated during the differentiation process of HMGB2-null NPCs. These epigenetic changes led to downstream changes in specific histone modification levels, specifically the trimethylation of H3K27, and a subsequent shift in the perinatal neurogenesis to gliogenesis fate transition. Collectively these results demonstrate that chromatin binding proteins, such as HMGB2, can have significant effects on the epigenetic landscape of perinatal neural stem/progenitor cells.']",['Not applicable 537'],[]

RPE dysfunction is a key feature of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of blindness in developed countries. Inflammation is a key pathogenic mechanism in AMD and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) has been implicated as a pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in AMD. While mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in AMD pathogenesis, the interplay between inflammation and cellular metabolism remains elusive. The present study explores how the pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNFα, impacts mitochondrial morphology and metabolic function in RPE. Matured human primary RPE (H-RPE) were treated with TNFα (10 ng/ml) for up to 5 days. TNFα-induced upregulation of IL-6 secretion and inflammatory genes (IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1) was accompanied by increased oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and reduced glycolysis, leading to an increase in cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed defects in mitochondrial morphology with engorged mitochondria and loss of cristae integrity following TNFα treatment. Pre-treatment with the anti-inflammatory drug, 80 μM dimethyl fumarate (DMFu), blocked TNFα-induced inflammatory activation of RPE (IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, CFH, CFB, C3) and normalized their bioenergetic profile to control levels by regulating PFKFB3 and PKM2 gene expression. Furthermore, DMFu prevented TNFα-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and morphological anomalies. Thus, our results indicate that DMFu serves as a novel therapeutic avenue for combating inflammatory activation and metabolic dysfunction of RPE in AMD.']","['The original contributions presented in this study are included in the article/supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author.']",[]

To signal species identity for mate recognition, some insects use the ratio of two components in a binary chemical mixture to produce a code that is invariant to dilution. Here, using psychophysical methods, we show that rats also classify binary odor mixtures according to the molar ratios of their components, spontaneously generalizing over at least a tenfold concentration range.

Aged mice showed a profound impairment in contextual discrimination compared to young animals. Voluntary exercise rescued this deficit to such an extent that behavioral pattern separation of aged-run mice was now similar to young animals. Running also resulted in a significant increase in the number of immature neurons with tertiary dendrites in aged mice.

In the case of breast cancer, although most individual tumors each have unique CNV landscape, the breakpoints, as measured over large datasets, appear to be non-randomly distributed in the genome. Breakpoints show a significant regional concentration at genomic loci spanning perhaps several megabases. The proximal cause of these breakpoint concentrations is a subject of speculation, but is, as yet, largely unknown. To shed light on this issue, we have performed a bio-statistical analysis on our previously published data for a set of 119 breast tumors and normal controls (Wiedswang et al., ', '), where each sample has both high-resolution CNV and methylation data. The method examined the distribution of closeness of breakpoint regions with differentially methylated regions (DMR), coupled with additional genomic parameters, such as repeat elements and designated “fragile sites” in the reference genome. Through this analysis, we have identified a set of 93 regional loci called breakpoint enriched DMR (BEDMRs) characterized by altered DNA methylation in cancer compared to normal cells that are associated with frequent breakpoint concentrations within a distance of 1\u2009Mb. BEDMR loci are further associated with local hypomethylation (66%), concentrations of the Alu SINE repeats within 3\u2009Mb (35% of the cases), and tend to occur near a number of cancer related genes such as the protocadherins, AKT1, DUB3, GAB2. Furthermore, BEDMRs seem to deregulate members of the histone gene family and chromatin remodeling factors, e.g., JMJD1B, which might affect the chromatin structure and disrupt coordinate signaling and repair. From this analysis we propose that preference for chromosomal breakpoints is related to genome structure coupled with alterations in DNA methylation and hence, chromatin structure, associated with tumorigenesis.']",['Not applicable 547'],[]

A detailed examination of these characteristics may provide new routes for therapeutic intervention in mood disorders, substance addiction, and neurodegenerative diseases. The relatively large size of the cell body provides a unique opportunity to understand the mechanism of this mode of neuronal exocytosis in microscopic detail. Here we used three photon and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to focus on the dynamics of the pre-exocytotic events and explore the nature of somatic vesicle storage, transport, and docking at the membrane of serotonergic neurons from raphe nuclei of the rat brain. We find that the vesicles (or unresolved vesicular clusters) are quiescent (mean square displacement, MSD ∼0.04\u2009μm', '/s) before depolarization, and they move minimally (<1\u2009μm) from their locations over a time-scale of minutes. However, within minutes of depolarization, the vesicles become more dynamic (MSD ∼0.3\u2009μm', '/s), and display larger range (several μm) motions, though without any clear directionality. Docking and subsequent exocytosis at the membrane happen at a timescale (∼25\u2009ms) that is slower than most synaptic exocytosis processes, but faster than almost all somatic exocytosis processes observed in endocrine cells. We conclude that, (A) depolarization causes de-tethering of the neurotransmitter vesicles from their storage locations, and this constitutes a critical event in somatic exocytosis; (B) their subsequent transport kinetics can be described by a process of constrained diffusion, and (C) the pre-exocytosis kinetics at the membrane is faster than most other somatic exocytosis processes reported so far.']",['Not applicable 550'],[]

Parallel processing (e.g., in the visual system), increases both computational capacity and processing speed by simultaneously coding different aspects of the same stimulus. Coincidence detection is an efficient way to integrate information from different sources. Coincidence has been shown to promote associative learning and memory or stimulus feature detection (e.g., in auditory delay lines). Within the dual olfactory pathway of the honeybee both of these mechanisms might be implemented by uniglomerular projection neurons (PNs) that transfer information from the primary olfactory centers, the antennal lobe (AL), to a multimodal integration center, the mushroom body (MB). PNs from anatomically distinct tracts respond to the same stimulus space, but have different physiological properties, characteristics that are prerequisites for parallel processing of different stimulus aspects. However, the PN pathways also display mirror-imaged like anatomical trajectories that resemble neuronal coincidence detectors as known from auditory delay lines. To investigate temporal processing of olfactory information, we recorded PN odor responses simultaneously from both tracts and measured coincident activity of PNs within and between tracts. Our results show that coincidence levels are different within each of the two tracts. Coincidence also occurs between tracts, but to a minor extent compared to coincidence within tracts.

(Normalized CpG content was computed as in [13]: fCG/eCG, where fCG is observed CG frequency, eCG is the expected frequency calculated as [(fC + fG)/2]2, and fC and fG are the frequencies of C and G, respectively.) This working definition is based on the observation that the CpG content follows a bimodal distribution, which naturally separates the promoters into two classes [11,13]. Saxonov and coworkers [13] used 0.35 as a threshold to define CpG-related or non-CpG-related promoters. Better classification results are produced when we are more strict in defining non-CpG-related promoters. (Additional data file 1 gives detailed comparisons between the program using 0.35 as the threshold and the program using 0.3 as the threshold.)To build any promoter model, one needs a collection of promoter sequences with high-quality annotation. We used the annotations from the EPD (version 79) [33] and the DBTSS (version 3.0) [2]. (EPD is based on experimentally determined TSSs, and DBTSS on full-length oligo-capped cDNA sequences.) EPD generally has better quality annotation than DBTSS, but because there are only 299 non-CpG-related promoters from EPD we also included 1,271 DBTSS-annotated promoters for training. After removing redundancy, we had 1,445 CpG-related promoters from EPD and 1,570 non-CpG-related promoters combining both EPD and DBTSS promoters. The promoter sequences 250 bp upstream and 50 bp downstream of the TSS were extracted as the positive training set. The four (two upstream and two downstream) nonoverlapping consecutive segments immediately upstream and downstream of the positive set were used as our negative training set.In the fivefold cross-validation study for non-CpG-related promoters, the set of 299 non-CpG-related promoters from EPD and four-fifths of 1,271 promoters from DBTSS was used to train a model, and the remaining set of one-fifth of the sequences of 2.4 kb each, centered at the DBTSS-annotated TSS, was used as test data.For comparison, we also applied different programs to the sequences extracted from the genome-wide mapping data of promoters obtained from the ChIP-chip technology [4]. Testing the trained model on a separate dataset is important to achieve an unbiased evaluation. Therefore, we kept those sequences 2.4 kb centered at the probes where there was only one DBTSS annotation and no more than one probe in the same sequence. This left us with 85 non-CpG-related and 1,765 CpG-related test sequences of 2.4 kb each.From CSHL Mammalian Promoter Database (CSHLmpd) [34], we defined the tissue-specific activity of each human promoter based on the tissue information of mRNAs and expressed sequence tags overlapping promoters at the 5' end. We found most housekeeping gene promoters to be CpG related, as expected, whereas promoters active in only a few tissues are more likely to be non-CpG related, consistent with previous reports [26,35]. Among 636 so-called tissue-specific non-CpG-related promoters, 84 are muscle specific. We applied leave-one-out cross-validation to this set of 84 promoters."", 'The following additional data are available with the online version of this article.

Previous research shows that "", ' expressing human α-synuclein A30P (A30P) develop deficits in geotaxis climbing; however, geotaxis climbing is a different movement modality from walking. Whether A30P flies would exhibit abnormal walking in a horizontal plane, a measure more relevant to PD, is not known. In this study, we characterized A30P fly walking using a high-speed camera and an automatic behavior tracking system. We found that old but not young A30P flies exhibited walking abnormalities, specifically decreased total moving distance, distance per movement, velocity, angular velocity and others, compared with old control flies. Those features match the definition of bradykinesia. Multivariate analysis further suggested a synergistic effect of aging and A30P, resulting in a distinct pattern of walking deficits, as seen in aged A30P flies. Psychiatric problems are common in PD patients with anxiety affecting 40–69% of patients. Central avoidance is one assessment of anxiety in various animal models. We found old but not young A30P flies exhibited increased centrophobism, suggesting possible elevated anxiety.

Such topological information is important when studying intratumor heterogeneity as well as alterations related to different steps in tumor progression. We developed a quantitative multigene fluorescence ', ' hybridization (QM FISH) method to detect multiple genomic regions in single cells in complex tissues. As a “proof of principle” we applied the method to breast cancer samples to identify partners in whole arm (WA) translocations. WA gain of chromosome arm 1q and loss of chromosome arm 16q are among the most frequent genomic events in breast cancer. By designing five specific FISH probes based on breakpoint information from comparative genomic hybridization array (aCGH) profiles, we visualized chromosomal translocations in clinical samples at the single cell level. By analyzing aCGH data from 295 patients with breast carcinoma with known molecular subtype, we found concurrent WA gain of 1q and loss of 16q to be more frequent in luminal A tumors compared to other molecular subtypes. QM FISH applied to a subset of samples (', '\u2009=\u200926) identified a derivative chromosome der(1;16)(q10;p10), a result of a centromere-close translocation between chromosome arms 1q and 16p. In addition, we observed that the distribution of cells with the translocation varied from sample to sample, some had a homogenous cell population while others displayed intratumor heterogeneity with cell-to-cell variation. Finally, for one tumor with both preinvasive and invasive components, the fraction of cells with translocation was lower and more heterogeneous in the preinvasive tumor cells compared to the cells in the invasive component. © 2014 The Authors Genes, Chromosomes & Cancer Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",['Not applicable 595'],[]

In particular, most sequences that are sufficiently stable to fold will have stabilities near the folding threshold. Here, we extend this argument to consider its predictions for epistatic interactions for the effects of mutations on the free energy of folding. Although there is abundant evidence to indicate that the effects of mutations on the free energy of folding are nearly additive and conserved over evolutionary time, we show that these observations are compatible with the hypothesis that a non-additive contribution to the folding free energy is essential for observed proteins to maintain their native structure.

Sex differences in the brain appear throughout the animal kingdom and are largely a consequence of the physiological requirements necessary for the distinct roles of the two sexes in reproduction. As with the rest of the body, gonadal steroid hormones act to specify and regulate many of these differences. It is thought that transient hormonal signaling during brain development gives rise to persistent sex differences in gene expression via an epigenetic mechanism, leading to divergent neurodevelopmental trajectories that may underlie sex differences in disease susceptibility. However, few genes with a persistent sex difference in expression have been identified, and only a handful of studies have employed genome-wide approaches to assess sex differences in epigenomic modifications. To date, there are no confirmed examples of gene regulatory elements that direct sex differences in gene expression in the brain. Here, we review foundational studies in this field, describe transcriptional mechanisms that could act downstream of hormone receptors in the brain, and suggest future approaches for identification and validation of sex-typical gene programs. We propose that sexual differentiation of the brain involves self-perpetuating transcriptional states that canalize sex-specific development.']",['Not applicable 598'],[]

We accomplish this by imprinting each template strand from a target region with a dense and unique mutation pattern. The mutation process randomly and independently converts ∼50% of cytosines to uracils. Sequencing libraries are made from both mutated and unmutated templates. Using de Bruijn graphs and paired-end read information, we assemble each mutated template and use the unmutated library to correct the mutated bases. Templates are partitioned into two or more haplotypes, and the final haplotypes are assembled and corrected for residual template mutations and PCR errors.

Because their repeat structure makes replication error-prone, variant microsatellite lengths are often generated during germline and other somatic expansions. As such, microsatellite length variations can serve as markers for cancer. However, accurate error-free measurement of microsatellite lengths is difficult with current methods precisely because of this high error rate during amplification. We have solved this problem by using partial mutagenesis to disrupt enough of the repeat structure of initial templates so that their sequence lengths replicate faithfully. In this work, we use bisulfite mutagenesis to convert a C to a U, later read as T. Compared to untreated templates, we achieve three orders of magnitude reduction in the error rate per round of replication. By requiring agreement from two independent first copies of an initial template, we reach error rates below one in a million.

Point mutations leading to cryptic 5′ss activation were most common in the first intron nucleotide, followed by the fifth nucleotide.

Accurately determining the diversity of mtDNA has been difficult, due to the relatively small amount of mtDNA in each cell (<1% of the total DNA), the intercellular variability of mtDNA content and mtDNA pseudogenes (Numts) in nDNA. To understand the nature of heteroplasmy, we developed Mseek, a novel technique to purify and sequence mtDNA. Mseek yields high purity (>90%) mtDNA and its ability to detect rare variants is limited only by sequencing depth, providing unprecedented sensitivity and specificity. Using Mseek, we confirmed the ubiquity of heteroplasmy by analyzing mtDNA from a diverse set of cell lines and human samples. Applying Mseek to colonies derived from single cells, we find heteroplasmy is stably maintained in individual daughter cells over multiple cell divisions. We hypothesized that the stability of heteroplasmy could be facilitated by intercellular exchange of mtDNA.

PCR is a fundamental step in preparing DNA samples for high-throughput sequencing. However, there are errors associated with PCR-mediated amplification. Here we examine the effects of four important sources of error—bias, stochasticity, template switches and polymerase errors—on sequence representation in low-input next-generation sequencing libraries. We designed a pool of diverse PCR amplicons with a defined structure, and then used Illumina sequencing to search for signatures of each process. We further developed quantitative models for each process, and compared predictions of these models to our experimental data. We find that PCR stochasticity is the major force skewing sequence representation after amplification of a pool of unique DNA amplicons. Polymerase errors become very common in later cycles of PCR but have little impact on the overall sequence distribution as they are confined to small copy numbers. PCR template switches are rare and confined to low copy numbers. Our results provide a theoretical basis for removing distortions from high-throughput sequencing data. In addition, our findings on PCR stochasticity will have particular relevance to quantification of results from single cell sequencing, in which sequences are represented by only one or a few molecules.']",['Not applicable 655'],[]

Thus, we propose that uncapped asRNA corresponds to the aberrant RNA molecule that is converted to dsRNA by RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 6 in siRNA-bodies to initiate S-PTGS, whereas capped asRNA must anneal with sense RNA to produce dsRNA that initiate AS-PTGS.']",['Not applicable 656'],[]

In SYNseq, each neuron is labeled with a unique random nucleotide sequence—an RNA ‘barcode’—which is targeted to the synapse using engineered proteins. Barcodes in pre- and postsynaptic neurons are then associated through protein-protein crosslinking across the synapse, extracted from the tissue, and joined into a form suitable for sequencing.

Benchmarking assessments often highlight methods’ good performance, but are focused on either model data or fail to explain variation in performance. This leaves us to ask, what is the most meaningful way to assess different alignment choices? And importantly, where is there room for progress? In this work, we explore the answers to these two questions by performing an exhaustive assessment of the STAR aligner. We assess STAR’s performance across a range of alignment parameters using common metrics, and then on biologically focused tasks. We find technical metrics such as fraction mapping or expression profile correlation to be uninformative, capturing properties unlikely to have any role in biological discovery. Surprisingly, we find that changes in alignment parameters within a wide range have little impact on both technical and biological performance. Yet, when performance finally does break, it happens in difficult regions, such as X-Y paralogs and MHC genes. We believe improved reporting by developers will help establish where results are likely to be robust or fragile, providing a better baseline to establish where methodological progress can still occur.']","['We perform all our assessments on publically available RNA-seq data.

The off-target events caused by the uniformly modified ASOs tested in this study were significantly reduced with mixed-chemistry ASOs of the same sequence. Furthermore, using shorter ASOs, combining two ASOs, and delivering ASOs by free uptake also reduced off-target activity.

The co-cultures showed cooperative interactions and revealed another distinct subpopulation of CAFs, located more distantly from neoplastic cells, which lacked elevated αSMA expression and instead secreted IL6 and additional inflammatory mediators. These findings were corroborated in mouse and human PDA tissue, providing direct evidence for CAF heterogeneity in PDA tumor biology with implications for disease etiology and therapeutic development.']",['Not applicable 716'],[]

Amin et al. show that their respective M4 segments, located on the periphery of their pore domains, contribute to their functional diversity.', 'Ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs), including AMPA receptor (AMPAR) and NMDA receptor (NMDAR) subtypes, are ligand-gated ion channels that mediate signaling at the majority of excitatory synapses in the nervous system. The iGluR pore domain is structurally and evolutionarily related to an inverted two-transmembrane K', ' channel. Peripheral to the pore domain in eukaryotic iGluRs is an additional transmembrane helix, the M4 segment, which interacts with the pore domain of a neighboring subunit. In AMPARs, the integrity of the alignment of a specific face of M4 with the adjacent pore domain is essential for receptor oligomerization. In contrast to AMPARs, NMDARs are obligate heterotetramers composed of two GluN1 and typically two GluN2 subunits. Here, to address the function of the M4 segments in NMDARs, we carry out a tryptophan scan of M4 in GluN1 and GluN2A subunits. Unlike AMPARs, the M4 segments in NMDAR subunits makes only a limited contribution to their biogenesis. However, the M4 segments in both NMDAR subunits are critical for receptor activation, with mutations at some positions, most notably at the extreme extracellular end, completely halting the gating process. Furthermore, although the AMPAR M4 makes a minimal contribution to receptor desensitization, the NMDAR M4 segments have robust and subunit-specific effects on desensitization. These findings reveal that the functional roles of the M4 segments in AMPARs and NMDARs have diverged in the course of their evolution and that the M4 segments in NMDARs may act as a transduction pathway for receptor modulation at synapses.']",['Not applicable 725'],[]

Here, we used a tissue-specific strategy to investigate the spatial signaling requirements of BR-mediated QC divisions. We generated stem cell niche-specific receptor knockout lines by placing an artificial microRNA against BRI1 (BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1) under the control of the QC-specific promoter WOX5. Additionally, QC-specific knock-in lines for BRI1 and its downstream transcription factor BES1 (BRI1-EMS-SUPPRESOR1) were also created using the WOX5 promoter.

Unfortunately, sorafenib showed very modest effects in a multi-institutional phase II trial in advanced uterine carcinoma patients. Here, by leveraging RNA-sequencing data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and cell survival studies from compound-based high-throughput screenings we have identified the lysosomal pathway as a potential compartment involved in the resistance to sorafenib.

The single prolonged stress (SPS) is a multimodal stress protocol that comprises a sequential exposure to physical restraint, forced swimming, predator scent and ether anesthesia. This procedure generates behavioral and neurobiological alterations that resemble clinical findings of PTSD, and thus it is commonly used to model the disease in rodents. Here, we applied c-fos mapping to produce a comprehensive view of stress-activated brain regions in mice exposed to SPS alone or to SPS after oral pretreatment with the serotonin-noradrenaline receptor dual modulator ACH-000029 or the α1-adrenergic blocker prazosin. The SPS protocol evoked c-fos expression in several brain regions that control the stress-anxiety response, including the central and medial amygdala, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the pallidum, the paraventricular hypothalamus, the intermediodorsal, paraventricular and central medial thalamic nuclei, the periaqueductal gray, the lateral habenula and the cuneiform nucleus. These effects were partially blocked by pretreatment with prazosin but completely prevented by ACH-000029. Collectively, these findings contribute to the brain-wide characterization of neural circuits involved in PTSD-related stress responses. Furthermore, the identification of brain areas regulated by ACH-000029 and prazosin revealed regions in which SPS-induced activation may depend on the combined or isolated action of the noradrenergic and serotonergic systems. Finally, the dual regulation of serotonin and α1 receptors by ACH-000029 might represent a potential pharmacotherapy that can be applied in the peri-trauma or early post-trauma period to mitigate the development of symptoms in PTSD patients.']",['Not applicable 775'],[]

Many fast-evolving genes and noncoding sequences in the human genome have GC-biased substitution patterns, suggesting that gBGC—in contrast to adaptive processes—may have driven the human changes in these sequences. To investigate this hypothesis, we developed a substitution model for DNA sequence evolution that quantifies the nonlinear interacting effects of selection and gBGC on substitution rates and patterns. Based on this model, we used a series of lineage-specific likelihood ratio tests to evaluate sequence alignments for evidence of changes in mode of selection, action of gBGC, or both. With a false positive rate of less than 5% for individual tests, we found that the majority (76%) of previously identified human accelerated regions are best explained without gBGC, whereas a substantial minority (19%) are best explained by the action of gBGC alone. Further, more than half (55%) have substitution rates that significantly exceed local estimates of the neutral rate, suggesting that these regions may have been shaped by positive selection rather than by relaxation of constraint. By distinguishing the effects of gBGC, relaxation of constraint, and positive selection we provide an integrated analysis of the evolutionary forces that shaped the fastest evolving regions of the human genome, which facilitates the design of targeted functional studies of adaptation in humans.']",['Not applicable 813'],[]

To test this hypothesis, we assembled two sets of data on putatively adaptive amino acid replacements that have occurred in parallel during evolution, either in nature or in the laboratory. We find that the frequency of transitions in these data sets is much higher than would be predicted under a null model where mutation has no effect.

In deep learning, normalization methods such as batch normalization, weight normalization, and their many variants help to stabilize hidden unit activity and accelerate network training, and these methods have been called one of the most important recent innovations for optimizing deep networks. In the brain, homeostatic plasticity represents a set of mechanisms that also stabilize and normalize network activity to lie within certain ranges, and these mechanisms are critical for maintaining normal brain function. In this article, we discuss parallels between artificial and biological normalization methods at four spatial scales: normalization of a single neuron's activity, normalization of synaptic weights of a neuron, normalization of a layer of neurons, and normalization of a network of neurons. We argue that both types of methods are functionally equivalent—that is, both push activation patterns of hidden units toward a homeostatic state, where all neurons are equally used—and we argue that such representations can improve coding capacity, discrimination, and regularization. As a proof of concept, we develop an algorithm, inspired by a neural normalization technique called "", ', and show that this algorithm performs competitively against existing normalization methods on several data sets. Overall, we hope this bidirectional connection will inspire neuroscientists and machine learners in three ways: to uncover new normalization algorithms based on established neurobiological principles; to help quantify the trade-offs of different homeostatic plasticity mechanisms used in the brain; and to offer insights about how stability may not hinder, but may actually promote, plasticity.']",['Not applicable 834'],[]

To determine whether acute exposure to low level LAN alters brain function, adult male and female mice were housed in either light days and dark nights (LD; 14h of 150 lux:10 h of 0 lux) or light days and low level light at night (LAN; 14h of 150 lux:10 h of 5 lux). Mice exposed to LAN on three consecutive nights increased depressive-like responses compared to mice housed in dark nights.

LAN was associated with reduced hippocampal vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) in both male and female mice, as well as increased VEGFR1 and interleukin-1β mRNA expression in females, and reduced brain derived neurotrophic factor mRNA in males.

All sgRNA sequences used are listed in Supplementary Table 2.Other plasmidsThe GO (C&gt;G) reporter was cloned by modifying the GO reporter system as described in ref.3. Briefly a custom GFP(ATC) gBlock cassette was inserted to EcoRI- and BsrgI-digested mUGISGO by standard InFusion assembly protocol. To insert GO3 sgRNA (C&gt;G targeting guide), mU6-GO3-scaffold was amplified. Both inserts were digested with XhoI and Nsil and ligated using T4 DNA ligase.Cell cultureHEK293T (ATCC CRL-3216), A549 (CCL-185), MDA-MB-231 (ATCC HTB-26), and KPT1 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 IU/mL of penicillin/streptomycin. KP cells4 were a kind gift from Dr. Tyler Jacks (MIT). PC9 cells were a kind gift from Dr. Harold Varmus (Weill Cornell) and cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 IU/mL of penicillin/streptomycin. NIH3T3 cells (ATCC CRL-1658) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 100 IU/mL of penicillin/streptomycin. Pancreatic ductal epithelial cells (PDECs)5 were a kind gift from Dr. Dafna Bar-Sagi (New York University) and cultured in collagen-coated plates (100 μg/mL PureCol 5005, Advanced Biomatrix) with Advanced DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco), 100 IU/mL of penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco), 100 mM Glutamax (Gibco), ITS Supplement (Sigma), 0.1 mg/mL soy trypsin-inhibitor (Gibco), Bovine Pituitary Extract (Gibco), 5 nM T3 (Sigma), 100 μg/mL Cholera toxin (Sigma), 4 μg/mL Dexamethasone (Sigma), and 10 ng/mL human EGF (Preprotech).Virus productionLentiviruses were produced by co-transfection of HEK293T cells with the relevant lentiviral transfer vector and packaging vectors psPax2 (Addgene, #12260) and pMD2.G (Addgene, #12259) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Viral supernatants were collected at 48 and 72 hours post transfection and stored at −80°C.Drug treatmentsNutlin-3 (Selleck Chemicals, S1061) was dissolved in DMSO at a stock concentration of 10 mM and used at a final concentration of 10 μM.Flow cytometric analysesGO validation experiments were measured in either a Thermo Fisher 2018 Attune NxT flow cytometer or a Guava Easycyte (Millipore). Fluorescence assisted cell sorting was performed in either BD FACS Aria II or Sony MA900 cell sorters.Protein analysis231’s, PC9’s, and 3T3s screen pellets were resuspended with 500ul RIPA buffer then centrifuged at 4°C at 13,000rpm to collect protein lysates. Antibodies used for western blot analyses were: Cas9 (CellSignaling, #19526S) and Actin (Abcam, #ab49900).Animal workAnimalsAll mouse experiments were approved by the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) Internal Animal Care and Use Committee under MSKCC IACUC protocol 11–06-018. Mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions, and food and water were provided ad libitum. Foxn1nu (Swiss nude) mice were purchased from Envigo. All mice used were 6 to 8 week-old females.Pancreatic orthotopic transplantsFor transplantation of PDEC cells into the pancreas of adult mice, animals were anesthetized and a survival surgery was performed to expose the pancreas. Independent of genotype, a total of 1×105 PDEC cells resuspended in 25 μL of growth factor reduced Matrigel (354230; Corning) diluted 1:1 with cold OptiMEM (Gibco) were injected into the tail region of the pancreas of each mouse. Mice were monitored for tumor development over time by abdominal palpation and were euthanized upon developing overt disease and becoming moribund following disease monitoring guidelines of IACUC and the MSKCC Animal Facility.Genomic DNA isolationIsolation of gDNA from cellsGenomic DNA was extracted from cells using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer’s instructions. Cell pellets were processed in parallel and resulting gDNA was resuspended in 100–200 μL of 10 mM Tris-Cl; 0.5 mM EDTA; pH 9.0. Samples from corresponding replicates from MBES and HBES screens were pooled at the gDNA level, measured using a NanoDrop 2000 (ThermoFisher), and normalized before performing sequencing deconvolution.Isolation of gDNA from tumor tissuesGenomic DNA was extracted from tissues using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer’s instructions. Multiple tumor fragments or nodules were microdissected and either processed immediately by finely mincing the tissue and incubating overnight in a lysis buffer containing proteinase K and following the manufacturer protocol or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C until day of processing. Resulting gDNA was resuspended in 100–200 μL of 10 mM Tris-Cl; 0.5 mM EDTA; pH 9.0, measured using a NanoDrop 2000 (ThermoFisher), and normalized before assessing genome editing at the relevant locus of interest using deep sequencing.AMINEsearch bioinformatic pipelineWe developed a genome editing design tool, AMINEsearch (Annotated Mutation-Informed Nucleotide Editing sgRNA search), implemented in R, to comprehensively build libraries of annotated gene editing reagents to model a user-defined set of mutations. This algorithm can be applied to any sequencing dataset that uses standard maf format files. For further description of the algorithm and analysis, including the process of library design, Off-target analysis, and conservation of variant protein sequence between human and mouse, please see Supplementary Note 1.HBES and MBES library designMSK-IMPACT sequencing data (n=21694 tumors) was used to design sgRNAs and sensors compatible with commonly used BE configurations, incorporating Cas variants (SpCas9, Cas9-NG, xCas9, and ScCas9) combined within the FNLS or F2X (expanded window) BE vector variants (Supplementary Table 2a–b). IMPACT-derived outputs of AMINEsearch (Supplementary Table 2c,e) were used to compile unique sensor constructs to construct HBES (Supplementary Table 2d) and MBES libraries (Supplementary Table 2f) that target the human and mouse genome, respectively. These libraries served as the basis for experimental validation and screening of base editing sensors, which are available under the “Sensor validated” tab of the BE-SCAN web portal (https://dowlab.shinyapps.io/BEscan/).AMINEsearch v2Modifications to the algorithm were made to increase functionality of the AMINEsearch algorithm. Specifically, modifications were made to accommodate BE variants that edit outside the region complementary to the sgRNA (CDA-BE4). As the demands of running larger dataset grew, we incorporated the capacity to run parallel execution on multiple cores or processors. The option to reverse the effects of mutations, rather than model them, given a list of pathogenic mutations as input, was added. A known issue was addressed to handle multiple genotypes that converge on the same protein sequence substitution as independent mutations. Version 2 includes the ability to track expected variant protein sequence when modeling human mutations in the mouse genome (See Supplementary Note 1). Versions 1 and 2 of the algorithm can be accessed at https://github.com/Kastenhuber/AMINEsearch/tree/AMINEsearch_v1.0 and https://github.com/Kastenhuber/AMINEsearch/tree/AMINEsearch_v2.0, respectively and are generalizable to analyze new mutation datasets and/or new base editor configurations.Exploratory set of BE sensor predictionsWe applied the algorithm to the recently updated mutation dataset from the MSK-IMPACT platform6, containing 341,736 total somatic cancer SNVs derived from targeted sequencing of 47,550 tumor samples (Supplementary Fig. 17). This targeted sequencing panel captures the coding region of up to 580 genes. Candidates for base editing included 5542 unique SNVs, classified as missense, nonsense, splice site, or nonstop mutations, which were observed greater than six or more times (&gt;0.01% frequency). We considered all combinations of 13 Cas9 orthologs and 11 deaminases, yielding 143 possible base editor configurations (Supplementary Table 8). This includes configurations that have been extensively characterized as well as combinations of Cas9 orthologs and deaminases that have not yet been assembled and used experimentally. Collectively, this exploratory set of sgRNA predictions provides a broad set of options to generate mutations in human and mouse (Supplementary Table 8). A searchable, filterable interface for the exploratory predicted set of sgRNAs are available under the “Sensor Design - Human” and “Sensor Design - Mouse” tabs in the shiny app web portal alongside sensor validated sgRNAs in BE-SCAN (https://dowlab.shinyapps.io/BEscan/).Design and construction of mouse and human base editing sensor librariesBase editing sensor module designEach sensor module is composed of the following parts: 1) a 22nt long 5’ adapter/priming site with a Esp3I restriction site; 2) a 20nt long 5’ G-containing sgRNA; 3) a 93nt long improved SpCas9 sgRNA scaffold partially based on7; 4) an 11nt long sequence corresponding to the 5’ flanking sequence of the endogenous target site; 5) the 23nt cognate target site; 6) a 7nt long sequence corresponding to the 3’ flanking sequence of the endogenous target site; 7) and a 28nt long 3’ adapter/priming site with a EcoRI restriction site. Thus, oligos encoding individual sensor modules are 204nt long.Cloning of mouse and human base editing sensor librariesDue to longer-than-average oligo length, early attempts at design and construction of sensor libraries showed unacceptable synthesis and assembly error rates where, in some instances, over half of the sensors before or after assembly into the backbone were found to harbor insertions, deletions, single nucleotide mutations, and incorrect chimeric sgRNA-target site molecules (data not shown). Through extensive trial and error, we found that assembling sensor libraries using Agilent’s High Fidelity oligo synthesis platform significantly mitigated these issues.All PAM sensor (APS) (1,152 oligos white-listed), MBES (4,686 oligos), and HBES (5,855 oligos) libraries were cloned into the pLRT2B backbone1 as follows (all library oligos are in Supplementary Table 2). Briefly, each oligo pool was amplified using forward and reverse primers that append Esp3I and EcoRI sites to the 5’ and 3’ ends of the sensor insert, purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen), and ligated into Esp3I-digested and dephosphorylated pLRT2B vector using high-concentration T4 DNA ligase (NEB) (all cloning and sequencing oligos are in Supplementary Table 9). To ensure maximum library recovery, we set up n=24 parallel PCR reactions per pool. A minimum of 2.4 ug of ligated pLRT2B plasmid DNA per pool (corresponding to n=8 ligations) was electroporated into Endura electrocompetent cells (Lucigen), recovered for one hour at 37C, plated across four 15cm LB-Carbenicillin plates (Teknova), and incubated at 37°C for 16 hours. The total number of bacterial colonies per pool was quantified using serial dilution plates to ensure a library representation of &gt;10,000X. The next morning, bacterial colonies were scraped and briefly expanded for 4 hours at 37°C in 500mL of LB-Carbenicillin. Plasmid DNA was isolated using the Plasmid Plus Maxi Kit (Qiagen). To assess sensor distribution and fidelity of assembly per pool, we amplified the sensor region using primers that append Illumina sequencing adapters on the 5’ and 3’ ends of the amplicon, as well as a random nucleotide stagger and unique demultiplexing barcode on the 5’ end (Supplementary Table 9). Library amplicons were size-selected on a 2.5% agarose gel, purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen), and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq instrument.Analysis of base editing activity using GO reporter systemBase editor expressing cells were plated at a density of 5,000 cells/well in 12 well plates and transduced 24 hours later with a defined amount of GO reporter to achieve 20–50% transduction efficiency. Virus-containing media was replaced with complete media 24 hours post-transduction and cells were harvested for flow cytometry at 96 hours post-transduction. We used an Attune NxT flow cytometer (Thermo Fisher). Cells were trypsinized with a 100 μl of 0.25% Trypsin+EDTA and resuspended in 300 μl of complete medium in a 96 well U bottom plate. Data was acquired at a flow rate of 500 μl/min and at least 10,000 events from the single cell population gating were recorded.Screening and deconvolution of mouse and human base editing sensor librariesScreening of mouse and human base editing sensor librariesWe first screened the APS library in MDA-MB-231 cells expressing one of nine different base editors, as well as either the Cas9 or Cas9-NG nucleases as cutting controls. APS screens were performed essentially as described below in detail. We then screened a total of five mouse and human base editor-expressing cell lines with either MBES or HBES libraries using the following approach. Human cell lines (MDA-MD-231 and PC9) were screened with MBES to minimize fitness differences between sensor modules due to endogenous targeting of genes that suppress cellular proliferation. Following the same rationale, mouse cell lines (KPT1, NIH3T3, and PDECs) were screened with HBES. Each screen (including the APS set) was performed as follows. To ensure that most cells harbor a single sgRNA integration event, we determined the volume of viral supernatant that would achieve an MOI between ~0.3–0.5 upon standard transduction of a population of base editor-expressing cells. All screens were performed in technical duplicate and each step of the screen – from infection to sequencing – was optimized to achieve a minimum representation of 1000X. For instance, to ensure a representation of &gt;1000X for HBES libraries at the transduction step, we spinfected a total of 24 million cells across two 12-well plates per technical replicate using the volume of viral supernatant that would achieve a 30% infection rate (~7.2 million transduced cells per technical replicate). 24 hours after infection, cells from each corresponding replicate were pooled into a minimum of 2 × 150mm tissue culture dishes (Corning) and selected with Blasticidin S (Gibco) at an empirically-determined final concentration ranging from 5 μg/mL to 30 μg/mL depending on the cell line. Cells were cultured and kept under Blasticidin selection for seven days post-transduction. When needed, cells were trypsinized and re-plated at a minimum of 6 million cells per replicate to ensure a minimum representation of 1000X. For PDEC screens, cell representation per replicate was maintained at &gt;600X at all points. Subsequently, at least 6 million cells were pelleted and stored at −20°C. Genomic DNA (gDNA) from cells was isolated using the DNeasy Blood &amp; Tissue Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s guidelines. Genomic DNA was harvested from all timepoints and both sensor BE activity and sgRNA abundance were assessed via NGS.Deconvolution of mouse and human base editing sensor screensWe assumed that each cell contains approximately 6.6 pg of gDNA. Therefore, screen deconvolution at 1000X required sampling ~6 million × 6.6 pg of gDNA, or ~39.6 ug. We employed a modified 2-step PCR version of the protocol published by Doench et al8 adapted to our unique library design. Briefly, we performed an initial PCR, whereby the integrated sensor cassettes were amplified from gDNA, followed by a second PCR to append Illumina sequencing adapters on the 5’ and 3’ ends of the amplicon, as well as a random hexamer and unique demultiplexing barcode on the 5’ end. Each “PCR1” reaction contained either 25 μL of Q5 High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix (NEB), 2.5 μL of Sensor_v6_Fwd Primer (10 μM), 2.5 μL of Sensor_v6_Rev Primer (10 μM), and 5 μg of gDNA in 20 μL of water (for a total volume of 50 μL per reaction) or 10μL of Herculase II 5X Master Mix (Agilent), 0.5 uL dNTPs, 2.5 μL of Sensor_v6_Fwd Primer (10 μM), 2.5 μL of Sensor_v6_Rev Primer (10 μM), 1 uL of Herculase II polymerase, and 5 μg of gDNA in 33.5 μL of water (for a total volume of 50 μL per reaction). The number of PCR1 reactions was scaled accordingly; therefore, we performed eight PCR1 reactions per technical replicate and time point for all screens. PCR1 amplicons were purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) and used as template for “PCR2” reactions. Each PCR2 reaction contained either 25 μL of NEBNext 2X Master Mix (NEB), 2.5 μL of a uniquely barcoded PCR2_Fwd Primer (10 μM), 2.5 μL of a common PCR2_Rev Primer (10 μM), and 300 ng of PCR1 product in 20 μL of water (for a total volume of 50 μL per reaction). We performed two PCR2 reactions per PCR1 product. Library amplicons were size-selected either on a 2.5% agarose gel and purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) or using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) followed by normalization, pooling, and sequencing on an Illumina NextSeq 500 instrument (150 nt paired-end reads). All primer sequences are available in Supplementary Table 6. PCR program for PCR1 using Q5 High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix (NEB) was: 1) 98°C × 30s; 2) 98°C × 10s; 3) 55°C × 30s; 4) 72°C × 30s; 5) Go to step 2 × 24 cycles; 6) 72°C × 2 min; 7) 4°C forever. When using Herculase II, denaturation steps were done at 95°C and the initial denaturation lasted for 2 minutes. PCR program for PCR2 using NEBNext 2X Master Mix (NEB) was: 1) 98°C × 30s; 2) 98°C × 10s; 3) 65°C × 30s; 4) 72°C × 30s; 5) Go to step 2 × 17 cycles; 6) 72°C × 2 min; 7) 4°C forever.Analysis of mouse and human base editing sensor screening dataTo quantify base editing outcomes, raw paired-end FASTQ reads were paired using Pandaseq and merged FASTQ files were used as input for downstream analysis. We first removed reads with mutated sgRNAs or scaffolds, or reads with non-matching sgRNA and target sequences (due to templates switching during PCR amplification). Next, the 5’ scaffold and linker were used to associate each sgRNA with the read; sgRNAs that did not match the whitelist were also discarded. All remaining reads were aligned to their cognate target found in the whitelist and aligned reads with no indels were considered for base editing analysis. Sensors that deviated from the expected length were flagged as indels and their actual frequency calculated as a specific insertion or deletion. Editing events were classified over all cytosines within a −5 to 20 position window of the target, where 1 is defined as the first position of the protospacer. Target cytosine editing (tCTN, tCGN, tCAN) quantified the frequency of editing at the target cytosine regardless of editing at other adjacent cytosines. Target cytosine editing without collateral editing (tCT) was measured as specific C&gt;T editing without associated mutations at adjacent sites. Purity values were calculated as the ratio of tCT/tCTN. Custom code to perform the BE analysis is available at: https://github.com/schmidt73/base-editing-analysis. All data for APS, HBES, and MBES screens can be found in Supplementary Tables 1, 4, and 5, respectively.Comparison of base editing sensor screening outcomes with BE-HiveTo consider the performance of the BE-Hive base-editing outcome prediction model in relation to our data, we pulled the fully trained network from the Github repository linked by Arbab et. al9. This model is split into two parts: a component that predicts the probability of any edit occurring and another that predicts the probability of a specific base editing outcome, conditioned on any editing occurring. These are referred to as the editing efficiency and bystander model, respectively. Per instructions, we fed in our input spacer and its 50-mer context to both models and computed the posterior probability of each observed outcome using the chain rule. One caveat is that the editing efficiency model directly predicts an un-transformed score, not a probability. To convert this to a probability, we sigmoid transformed it into the unit interval [0, 1]. Following the recommendations provided in their README file, we first linearly re-scaled the score using the mean and standard deviation of reads prior to sigmoid transforming it into a probability to account for variance in base editor expression by experimental condition and cell-type. We note that this is a monotonic operation; therefore, it should not affect any SpearmanR correlations used to analyze performance.BE-Hive does not consider PAM sequence as a feature in their prediction mode. Given that the PAM is an important determinant of the activity of standard base editors, we considered two different sets of sgRNAs in our comparisons. First, we considered all sgRNAs used in our screen. Second, we considered only the sgRNAs with canonical NGG PAMs.Phenotypic screens using base editing sensor librariesStable base editor-expressing KrasG12D/+; Trp53WT/WT pancreatic ductal epithelial cells (PDECs)5 were generated by lentiviral transduction with FNLS (Addgene, #110841) and validated using GO3 (Addgene, #136896). Phenotypic MBES screens in FNLS-PDECs were set up essentially as described above for HBES/MBES sensor screens with a few modifications. MBES FNLS-PDEC screens were performed across six independent transduction replicates in parallel. Each replicate was maintained at a minimum 500X representation at every step of the screen by replating 3 million cells per time point and pelleting the rest of the cells for gDNA isolation and screen deconvolution. Screens ran for approximately 36 cumulative population doublings across 34 days, after which we isolated gDNA and proceeded to perform screen deconvolution essentially as described above for MBES/HBES screens.Proliferation screen analysisPaired-end reads were joined using Pandaseq. Merged reads were processed as described for BE analysis above. Total read counts for each replicate were used as input for MAGeCK10, 11 analysis. Any sgRNA with read counts &lt; 100 were removed from analysis. Comparisons of T0 (day 5 post-transduction) versus T1 (day 14) and T2 (day 30 post-transduction) for each replicate were performed using MAGeCK to determine log fold changes. Base editing outcomes at the sensor target site were concurrently measured using the sensor screen pipeline described above.Validation experimentsFor validation of individual targets, sgRNAs were cloned into the lentiviral guide expression vector LRT2B (Addgene, #110854) and lentiviral particles were produced as described above. Base editor expressing cells were plated at a density of 25,000 cells/well in 12 well plates and were infected 24-hours later with enough virus to achieve 50% transduction efficiency. Virus-containing media was replaced with complete media 24 hours post-transduction and cells were plated into selection media containing 3 μg/mL Blasticidin S (Gibco). Experimental cells remained in selection media until the final collection time point at 7 days post-transduction. Final LRT2B infection efficiency was determined by measuring the levels of tdTomato in 10% of the cells remaining at day 7 using flow cytometry. Genomic DNA was isolated using the protocol found on dowlab.org/protocols, and targets were amplified using a 100 μl reaction following the standard NEB Taq 2x MM protocol with primers found in Supplementary Table 9. Each PCR was performed 3X/target and pooled. Amplicons were confirmed on a 2% agarose gel and PCR purified using QIAGEN QIAquick PCR purification kit. DNA concentration was measured using a Nanodrop and samples were normalized to 20 ng/μl and sequenced using EZ-amplicon sequencing (MiSeq; 2 × 250bp) by GENEWIZ, Inc (South Plainfield, NJ, USA).Analysis of deep sequencing data from validation experimentsCRISPResso212 was used to process sequencing reads from the validation experiments and the corresponding sensor sequencing results for each individual target. The data was analyzed on default CRISPResso2 base editor mode with the exception to the following parameters for endogenous locus results: -quantification_window_center −15 and sensor results: --quantification_window_size 10 --quantification_window_size 10 --base_editor_output --quantification_window_center −15 --exclude_bp_from_right 1 --plot_window_size 18. To calculate target C&gt;T editing and non-canonical editing we used the “Alleles_frequency_table_around_sgRNA.txt” file to get the read counts for a specific allele.Statistical analyses and Data VisualizationAnalysis and data visualization in RHeatmaps, dotplots, and correlation analyses (including correlation graphs) were performed in R version 3.6.3 and plots were produced using the ggplot2 and ggpubr package. Statistical considerations are reported in each figure legend.Analysis and data visualization in GraphPad PRISMAdditional bar plots, survival curves, and associated statistical analyses were generated using Prism 8 (GraphPad) and are indicated in figure legends. Error bars represent standard deviation, unless otherwise noted. We used Student’s t-test (unpaired, two-tailed) to assess significance between experimental and control groups, and to calculate P values. P&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.

By imaging developing mouse horizontal cells, we found that upon reaching their final laminar positions, these cells transiently elaborate vertical neurites that form non-overlapping columnar territories. Targeted cell ablation revealed that the vertical neurites engage in homotypic interactions resulting in tiling of neighboring cells prior to establishment of their dendritic fields.

The loss of Sap1-dependent barrier activity allows the unhindered progression of the replication fork, but results in rearrangements deleterious to the retrotransposon.

Zfp36l2 is normally downregulated during erythroid differentiation from the BFU-E stage but its expression is maintained by all tested GR agonists that stimulate BFU-E self-renewal, and the GR binds to several potential enhancer regions of Zfp36l2. Knockdown of Zfp36l2 in cultured BFU-E cells did not affect the rate of cell division but disrupted glucocorticoid-induced BFU-E self-renewal, and knockdown of Zfp36l2 in transplanted erythroid progenitors prevented expansion of erythroid lineage progenitors normally seen following induction of anemia by phenylhydrazine treatment. Zfp36l2 preferentially binds to mRNAs that are induced or maintained at high expression levels during terminal erythroid differentiation and negatively regulates their expression levels.

Yet synapses do not change radically at millisecond timescales. A key question then is: how is communication between neural circuits controlled? In motor control, brain areas directly involved in driving movement are active well before movement begins. Muscle activity is some readout of neural activity, yet remains largely unchanged during preparation. Here we find that during preparation, while the monkey holds still, changes in motor cortical activity cancel out at the level of these population readouts. Motor cortex can thereby prepare the movement without prematurely causing it. Further, we found evidence that this mechanism also operates in dorsal premotor cortex (PMd), largely accounting for how preparatory activity is attenuated in primary motor cortex (M1). Selective use of “output-null” vs. “output-potent” patterns of activity may thus help control communication to the muscles and between these brain areas.']",['Not applicable 954'],[]

Mechanistic analyses demonstrated that cell death was associated with robust reactive oxygen species production and could be efficiently antagonized with antioxidants. Mass spectrometry was employed to demonstrate selective uptake into pancreatic cancer cells.

Given recent advances in genomics and genetic screens, however, as well as an increasing urgency for the translation of effective preclinical treatments into the clinic, there is a pressing need to make these models easier and more efficient to work with. Accordingly, we have developed a versatile lentivirus-based approach to induce tumours from somatic cells of GEMs, add or subtract gene expression and render the tumours imageable from a simple breeding stock. The vectors deliver a tamoxifen-inducible and self-inactivating Cre recombinase, conditional bioluminescent and fluorescent proteins and an shRNA component. Following the transduction of somatic cells, tumours are initiated by Cre-mediated recombination of the inherited floxed alleles. Self-inactivation of Cre expression switches on the expression of luciferase, thereby rendering the recombined cells and resulting tumours bioluminescent. We demonstrate proof of concept of this approach by inducing bioluminescent lung tumours in conditional Kras and p53 mice. We also show that a variant vector expressing shRNA alters tumour growth dynamics and the histological grade associated with the inherited genotype. This approach comprises a versatile means to induce imageable and spontaneous tumour burden in mice. The vectors can be readily customized at the bench to modify reporter readout or tumour phenotype without additional transgenic strain development or breeding. They should also be useful for inducing imageable tumours in organs other than the lung, provided that the inherited conditional genotype is sufficiently penetrant. © 2013 The Authors.

Although sound-evoked neural responses in the anesthetized auditory cortex are mainly transient, recent experiments in the unanesthetized preparation have emphasized subpopulations with other response properties. To quantify the relative contributions of these different subpopulations in the awake preparation, we have estimated the representation of sounds across the neuronal population using a representative ensemble of stimuli. We used cell-attached recording with a glass electrode, a method for which single-unit isolation does not depend on neuronal activity, to quantify the fraction of neurons engaged by acoustic stimuli (tones, frequency modulated sweeps, white-noise bursts, and natural stimuli) in the primary auditory cortex of awake head-fixed rats. We find that the population response is sparse, with stimuli typically eliciting high firing rates (>20 spikes/second) in less than 5% of neurons at any instant. Some neurons had very low spontaneous firing rates (<0.01 spikes/second). At the other extreme, some neurons had driven rates in excess of 50 spikes/second. Interestingly, the overall population response was well described by a lognormal distribution, rather than the exponential distribution that is often reported.

Specific high- and moderate-affinity in vitro recognition sequences for each factor are enriched in bound regions. This enrichment, however, is not sufficient to explain the pattern of binding in vivo and varies in a context-dependent manner, demonstrating that higher-order rules must govern targeting of transcription factors. The more highly bound regions include all of the over 40 well-characterized enhancers known to respond to these factors as well as several hundred putative new ', 'regulatory modules clustered near developmental regulators and other genes with patterned expression at this stage of embryogenesis.

The finished clone-based assembly of the mouse strain C57BL/6J reported here has over 175,000 fewer gaps and over 139 Mb more of novel sequence, compared with the earlier MGSCv3 draft genome assembly. In a comprehensive analysis of this revised genome sequence, we are now able to define 20,210 protein-coding genes, over a thousand more than predicted in the human genome (19,042 genes). In addition, we identified 439 long, non–protein-coding RNAs with evidence for transcribed orthologs in human. We analyzed the complex and repetitive landscape of 267 Mb of sequence that was missing or misassembled in the previously published assembly, and we provide insights into the reasons for its resistance to sequencing and assembly by whole-genome shotgun approaches.

Clear differences are seen in number and variety of genes of the avian immune system where expansions and novel genes are less frequent than examples of gene loss. The turkey genome sequence provides resources to further understand the evolution of vertebrate genomes and genetic variation underlying economically important quantitative traits in poultry.

We present an analysis of the genome of the centipede ', '. It retains a compact genome that has undergone less gene loss and shuffling than previously sequenced arthropods, and many orthologues of genes conserved from the bilaterian ancestor that have been lost in insects. Our analysis locates many genes in conserved macro-synteny contexts, and many small-scale examples of gene clustering. We describe several examples where ', ' shows different solutions from insects to similar problems. The insect olfactory receptor gene family is absent from ', ', and olfaction in air is likely effected by expansion of other receptor gene families.

1039,The Constrained Maximal Expression Level Owing to Haploidy Shapes Gene Content on the Mammalian X ChromosomeA Limit to the Expression Level on the X Chromosome,2015,"['Laurence D. Hurst', 'Avazeh T. Ghanbarian', 'Alistair R. R. Forrest', 'Lukasz Huminiecki']",['PLoS Biology'],[],26685068,['4686125'],10.1371/journal.pbio.1002315,"['X chromosomes are unusual in many regards, not least of which is their nonrandom gene content. The causes of this bias are commonly discussed in the context of sexual antagonism and the avoidance of activity in the male germline. Here, we examine the notion that, at least in some taxa, functionally biased gene content may more profoundly be shaped by limits imposed on gene expression owing to haploid expression of the X chromosome. Notably, if the X, as in primates, is transcribed at rates comparable to the ancestral rate (per promoter) prior to the X chromosome formation, then the X is not a tolerable environment for genes with very high maximal net levels of expression, owing to transcriptional traffic jams. We test this hypothesis using The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and data from the Functional Annotation of the Mammalian Genome (FANTOM5) project. As predicted, the maximal expression of human X-linked genes is much lower than that of genes on autosomes: on average, maximal expression is three times lower on the X chromosome than on autosomes. Similarly, autosome-to-X retroposition events are associated with lower maximal expression of retrogenes on the X than seen for X-to-autosome retrogenes on autosomes. Also as expected, X-linked genes have a lesser degree of increase in gene expression than autosomal ones (compared to the human/Chimpanzee common ancestor) if highly expressed, but not if lowly expressed. The traffic jam model also explains the known lower breadth of expression for genes on the X (and the Z of birds), as genes with broad expression are, on average, those with high maximal expression. As then further predicted, highly expressed tissue-specific genes are also rare on the X and broadly expressed genes on the X tend to be lowly expressed, both indicating that the trend is shaped by the maximal expression level not the breadth of expression per se. Importantly, a limit to the maximal expression level explains biased tissue of expression profiles of X-linked genes. Tissues whose tissue-specific genes are very highly expressed (e.g., secretory tissues, tissues abundant in structural proteins) are also tissues in which gene expression is relatively rare on the X chromosome. These trends cannot be fully accounted for in terms of alternative models of biased expression. In conclusion, the notion that it is hard for genes on the Therian X to be highly expressed, owing to transcriptional traffic jams, provides a simple yet robustly supported rationale of many peculiar features of X’s gene content, gene expression, and evolution.', 'Laurence Hurst, Lukasz Huminiecki, and the FANTOM5 consortium propose a new explanation for the peculiar expression properties of genes on the human X chromosome, based on the premise that very high expression levels cannot be achieved on a haploid-expressed chromosome.', 'Genes located on the human X chromosome are not a random mix of genes: they tend to be expressed in relatively few tissues or are specific for a particular set of tissues, e.g., brain regions. Prior attempts to explain this skewed gene content have hypothesized that the X chromosome might be peculiar because it has to balance mutations that are advantageous to one sex but deleterious to the other, or because it has to shut down during the process of sperm manufacture in males. Here we suggest and test a third possible explanation: that genes on the X chromosome are limited in their transcription levels and thus tend to be genes that are lowly or specifically expressed. We consider the suggestion that since these genes can only be expressed from one chromosome, as males only have one X, the ability to express a gene at very high rates is limited owing to potential transcriptional traffic jams. As predicted, we find that human X-located genes have maximal expression rates far below that of genes residing on autosomes. When we look at genes that have moved onto or off the X chromosome during recent evolution, we find the maximal expression is higher when not on the X chromosome. We also find that X-located genes that are relatively highly expressed are not able to increase their expression level further. Our model explains both the enrichment for tissue specificity and the paucity of certain tissues with X-located genes. Genes underrepresented on the X are either expressed in many tissues—such genes tend to have high maximal expression—or are from tissues that require a lot of transcription (e.g., fast secreting tissues like the liver). Just as many of the findings cannot be explained by the two earlier models, neither can the traffic jam model explain all the peculiar features of the genes found on the X chromosome. Indeed, we find evidence of a reproduction-related bias in X-located genes, even after allowing for the traffic jam problem.']","[""All relevant data for our analysis are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.

However, as with any type of expression data, cross-dataset benchmarking of spatial data is a crucial first step. Here, we assess the replicability, with reference to canonical brain subdivisions, between the Allen Institute’s in situ hybridization data from the adult mouse brain (Allen Brain Atlas (ABA)) and a similar dataset collected using spatial transcriptomics (ST).

Aside from these, the biologically relevant targets of Pum in the nervous system remain largely unknown. We hypothesized that Pum might play a role in regulating the local translation underlying synapse-specific modifications during memory formation. To identify relevant translational targets, we used an informatics approach to predict Pum targets among mRNAs whose products have synaptic localization. We then used both in vitro binding and two in vivo assays to functionally confirm the fidelity of this informatics screening method.

Whether and how GABAergic inhibition influences STDP is not well understood. Using a model neuron driven by converging inputs modifiable by STDP, we determined that a sufficient level of inhibition was critical to ensure that temporal coherence (correlation among presynaptic spike times) of synaptic inputs, rather than initial strength or number of inputs within a pathway, controlled postsynaptic spike timing. Inhibition exerted this effect by preferentially reducing synaptic efficacy, the ability of inputs to evoke postsynaptic action potentials, of the less coherent inputs. In visual cortical slices, inhibition potently reduced synaptic efficacy at ages during but not before the critical period of ocular dominance (OD) plasticity. Whole-cell recordings revealed that the amplitude of unitary IPSCs from parvalbumin positive (Pv+) interneurons to pyramidal neurons increased during the critical period, while the synaptic decay time-constant decreased. In addition, intrinsic properties of Pv+ interneurons matured, resulting in an increase in instantaneous firing rate. Our results suggest that maturation of inhibition in visual cortex ensures that the temporally coherent inputs (e.g. those from the open eye during monocular deprivation) control postsynaptic spike times of binocular neurons, a prerequisite for Hebbian mechanisms to induce OD plasticity.', 'Evidence suggests that maturation of inhibition is required for the development of plasticity to proceed in the visual cortex. However, the mechanisms by which increased inhibition promotes plasticity are not clear. Here we characterized the maturation of synaptic and intrinsic ionic properties of parvalbumin-positive interneurons, a prominent subtype of inhibitory neuron in the cortex. We used a simple integrate-and-fire model to simulate the influence of maturation of inhibition on associative plasticity rules. We simulated two input pathways that converged onto a single postsynaptic neuron. The temporal pattern of activity was constructed differently for the two pathways: one pathway represented visually-driven activity, while the other pathway represented sensory-deprived activity. In mature circuits it is established that postsynaptic cells can select for sensory-driven inputs over deprived inputs, even in the case that deprived inputs have an initial advantage in synaptic size or number. We demonstrated that maturation of inhibition was required for postsynaptic cells to appropriately select sensory-driven patterns of activity when challenged with an opponent pathway of greater size. These results outline a mechanism by which maturation of inhibition can promote plasticity in the young, a period of development that is characterized by heightened learning.']",['Not applicable 1048'],[]

An extensively validated principle called guilt by association states that genes which are associated or interacting are more likely to share function. Guilt by association provides the central top-down principle for analyzing gene networks in functional terms or assessing their quality in encoding functional information. In this work, we show that functional information within gene networks is typically concentrated in only a very few interactions whose properties cannot be reliably related to the rest of the network. In effect, the apparent encoding of function within networks has been largely driven by outliers whose behaviour cannot even be generalized to individual genes, let alone to the network at large. While experimentalist-driven analysis of interactions may use prior expert knowledge to focus on the small fraction of critically important data, large-scale computational analyses have typically assumed that high-performance cross-validation in a network is due to a generalizable encoding of function. Because we find that gene function is not systemically encoded in networks, but dependent on specific and critical interactions, we conclude it is necessary to focus on the details of how networks encode function and what information computational analyses use to extract functional meaning. We explore a number of consequences of this and find that network structure itself provides clues as to which connections are critical and that systemic properties, such as scale-free-like behaviour, do not map onto the functional connectivity within networks.', 'The analysis of gene function and gene networks is a major theme of post-genome biomedical research.

In the past ten years, GBA has been scaled up for application to large gene networks, becoming a favored way to grapple with the complex interdependencies of gene functions in the face of floods of genomics and proteomics data. However, there is a growing realization that scaled-up GBA is not a panacea. In this study, we report a precise identification of the limits of GBA and show that it cannot provide a way to understand gene networks in a way that is simultaneously general and useful.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), a major application of NGS, is a widely adopted technique for examining protein-DNA interactions and is commonly used to investigate epigenetic signatures of diffuse histone marks. These datasets have notoriously high variance and subtle levels of enrichment across large expanses, making them exceedingly difficult to define. Windows-based, heuristic models and finite-state hidden Markov models (HMMs) have been used with some success in analyzing ChIP-seq data but with lingering limitations. To improve the ability to detect broad regions of enrichment, we developed a stochastic Bayesian Change-Point (BCP) method, which addresses some of these unresolved issues. BCP makes use of recent advances in infinite-state HMMs by obtaining explicit formulas for posterior means of read densities. These posterior means can be used to categorize the genome into enriched and unenriched segments, as is customarily done, or examined for more detailed relationships since the underlying subpeaks are preserved rather than simplified into a binary classification. BCP performs a near exhaustive search of all possible change points between different posterior means at high-resolution to minimize the subjectivity of window sizes and is computationally efficient, due to a speed-up algorithm and the explicit formulas it employs. In the absence of a well-established “gold standard” for diffuse histone mark enrichment, we corroborated BCP's island detection accuracy and reproducibility using various forms of empirical evidence.

One such difficulty is the large variation in read density profiles from different types of NGS data, including variable peak “shapes” ranging from punctate to diffuse enrichment segments. To address this issue, we developed an infinite-state hidden Markov model that resulted in explicit formulas for the estimation of read density enrichment and can be used to find both significant “peaks” and broad segments.

To help address this problem, we introduce a framework for predicting new interactions that aid connectivity between upstream proteins (sources) and downstream transcription factors (targets) of a particular pathway. Our algorithms attempt to globally minimize the distance between sources and targets by finding a small set of shortcut edges to add to the network. Unlike existing algorithms for predicting general protein interactions, by focusing on proteins involved in specific responses our approach homes-in on pathway-consistent interactions. We applied our method to extend pathways in osmotic stress response in yeast and identified several missing interactions, some of which are supported by published reports. We also performed experiments that support a novel interaction not previously reported. Our framework is general and may be applicable to edge prediction problems in other domains.', 'Networks of protein interactions encode a variety of molecular processes occurring in the cell. Embedded within these networks are important subnetworks called signaling pathways. Pathways are initiated by upstream proteins (called sources) that receive signals from the environment and trigger a cascade of information to downstream proteins (targets). Modeling the interactions that occur within this cascade is important because pathway disruption has been linked to several diseases. Further, the interactions help us better understand how cells respond to various conditions and environments. Unfortunately, interaction networks today are largely incomplete, which makes this analysis difficult. We provide a framework to model missing interactions in pathways by searching for interactions that putatively result in quicker and more efficient source-target cascades. We find that we can substantially shorten source-target distances with only a few additional edges and that many of our predicted edges have support in several knowledge databases and literature reports. We believe our approach will be useful to identify interesting and important pathway-centric interactions that have been missed by previous experimental assays.']",['Not applicable 1052'],[]

Doing so, we identify the epigenetic marks essential for the bistability of epigenetic states. The model explicitly incorporates two key chromatin marks, namely H4K16 acetylation and H3K79 methylation, and explores whether the presence of multiple marks lead to a qualitatively different systems behavior. We find that having both modifications is important for the robustness of epigenetic silencing. Besides the silenced and transcriptionally active fate of chromatin, our model leads to a novel state with bivalent (i.e., both active and silencing) marks under certain perturbations (knock-out mutations, inhibition or enhancement of enzymatic activity). The bivalent state appears under several perturbations and is shown to result in patchy silencing. We also show that the titration effect, owing to a limited supply of silencing proteins, can result in counter-intuitive responses. The design principles of the silencing system is systematically investigated and disparate experimental observations are assessed within a single theoretical framework. Specifically, we discuss the behavior of Sir protein recruitment, spreading and stability of silenced regions in commonly-studied mutants (e.g., ', '\n', ', ', '\n', ') illuminating the controversial role of Dot1 in the systems biology of yeast silencing.', 'Epigenetics is the study of heritable phenotypic variations that are not caused by changes in the genotype.

However, the SIR mechanism is not completely understood and it is important to investigate whether as-yet-undiscovered components alter the systems design in a fundamental way. We address this question using minimal models constructed from experimentally known interactions. Rather than building a detailed network model with parameters to fit for quantitative predictions, we build an effective model and study its bifurcation diagram which leads to robust qualitative predictions on the nature of mutants. This minimal modeling delineates a phase space with qualitatively different epigenetic mechanisms and states; some of which arise from drug/genetic perturbations and exhibit large cell-to-cell variation in chromatin marks.

This is a fundamental process that occurs in many brain regions and organisms, yet, despite decades of study of this process, the rate of synapse elimination, and how such rates affect the function and structure of networks, has not been studied. We performed large-scale brain imaging experiments to quantify synapse elimination rates in the developing mouse cortex and found that the rate is decreasing over time (i.e. aggressive elimination occurs early, followed by a longer phase of slow elimination). We show that such rates optimize the efficiency and robustness of distributed routing networks under several models.

Through a re-analysis of ENCODE data, we show that replicability of transcript abundances will provide misleading estimates of the replicability of conditional variation in transcript abundances (i.e., most expression experiments). Heuristics which implicitly address this problem have emerged in quality control measures to obtain ‘good’ differential expression results. However, these methods involve strict filters such as discarding low expressing genes or using technical replicates to remove discordant transcripts, and are costly or simply ad hoc. As an alternative, we model gene-level replicability of differential activity using co-expressing genes. We find that sets of housekeeping interactions provide a sensitive means of estimating the replicability of expression changes, where the co-expressing pair can be regarded as pseudo-replicates of one another. We model the effects of noise that perturbs a gene’s expression within its usual distribution of values and show that perturbing expression by only 5% within that range is readily detectable (AUROC~0.73). We have made our method available as a set of easily implemented R scripts.', 'RNA-sequencing has become a popular means to detect the expression levels of genes. However, quality control is still challenging, requiring both extreme measures and rules which are set in stone from extensive previous analysis. Instead of relying on these rules, we show that co-expression can be used to measure biological replicability with extremely high precision. Co-expression is a well-studied phenomenon in which two genes that are known to form a functional unit are also expressed at similar levels, and change in similar ways across conditions. Using this concept, we can detect how well an experiment replicates by measuring how well it has retained the co-expression pattern across defined gene-pairs. We do this by measuring how easy it is to detect a sample to which some noise has been added. We show this method is a useful tool for quality control.']","['To illustrate our analyses, we used data from publically accessible RNA-seq experiments where we define an experiment as a set of samples.

One often wishes to compute quantitative summaries of such structure—a basic example is the frequency spectrum—and compare with model-based predictions. The advent of large-scale population recordings affords the opportunity to do so in new ways, with the hope of distinguishing between potential explanations for why responses vary with time. We introduce a method that assesses a basic but previously unexplored form of population-level structure: when data contain responses across multiple neurons, conditions, and times, they are naturally expressed as a third-order tensor. We examined tensor structure for multiple datasets from primary visual cortex (V1) and primary motor cortex (M1). All V1 datasets were ‘simplest’ (there were relatively few degrees of freedom) along the neuron mode, while all M1 datasets were simplest along the condition mode. These differences could not be inferred from surface-level response features. Formal considerations suggest why tensor structure might differ across modes. For idealized linear models, structure is simplest across the neuron mode when responses reflect external variables, and simplest across the condition mode when responses reflect population dynamics. This same pattern was present for existing models that seek to explain motor cortex responses. Critically, only dynamical models displayed tensor structure that agreed with the empirical M1 data. These results illustrate that tensor structure is a basic feature of the data. For M1 the tensor structure was compatible with only a subset of existing models.', 'Neuroscientists commonly measure the time-varying activity of neurons in the brain. Early studies explored how such activity directly encodes sensory stimuli. Since then neural responses have also been found to encode abstract parameters such as expected reward. Yet not all aspects of neural activity directly encode identifiable parameters: patterns of activity sometimes reflect the evolution of underlying internal computations, and may be only obliquely related to specific parameters. For example, it remains debated whether cortical activity during movement relates to parameters such as reach velocity, to parameters such as muscle activity, or to underlying computations that culminate in the production of muscle activity. To address this question we exploited an unexpected fact. When activity directly encodes a parameter it tends to be mathematically simple in a very particular way. When activity reflects the evolution of a computation being performed by the network, it tends to be mathematically simple in a different way. We found that responses in a visual area were simple in the first way, consistent with encoding of parameters. We found that responses in a motor area were simple in the second way, consistent with participation in the underlying computations that culminate in movement.']",['All data files are available from the Dryad database.

The form that this competition should take depends critically on the noise corrupting these signals. In this study we show that for the type of noise commonly observed in sensory systems, whose variance scales with the mean signal, sensory neurons should selectively divide their input signals by their predictions, suppressing ambiguous cues while amplifying others. Any change in the stimulus context alters which inputs are suppressed, leading to a deep dynamic reshaping of neural receptive fields going far beyond simple surround suppression. Paradoxically, these highly variable receptive fields go alongside and are in fact required for an invariant representation of external sensory features. In addition to offering a normative account of context-dependent changes in sensory responses, perceptual inference in the presence of signal-dependent noise accounts for ubiquitous features of sensory neurons such as divisive normalization, gain control and contrast dependent temporal dynamics.', 'Perception involves using incoming sensory signals to infer which objects or features are present in the surroundings. To do this, sensory systems must perform two basic operations: (i) combination of noisy sensory cues, and (ii) competition between different percepts. Here we show that the optimal form of competition depends on how sensory signals are corrupted by noise. Moreover, for the type of noise commonly observed in sensory systems, whose variance scales with the signal amplitude, competition should occur between different sensory cues ', ' they are combined. Implemented neurally, this results in a highly flexible representation, in which neural receptive fields change dynamically depending on the stimulus context.

To regularize over the high-dimensionality of our parameter space (which is a product space of the rigid motion dimensions and the diffeomorphism dimensions), the histology stacks are modelled as arising from a first order Sobolev space smoothness prior. We show that the joint maximum a-posteriori, penalized-likelihood estimator of our high dimensional parameter space emerges as a joint optimization interleaving rigid motion estimation for histology restacking and large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping to atlas coordinates.

Automated mapping of pre-labeled atlases onto modern large datasets of histological imagery is a critical step for elucidating the brain’s neural circuitry and shape. This task is challenging as histological sections are imaged independently and the reconstruction of the unsectioned volume is nontrivial. Typically, neuroanatomists use reference volumes of the same subject (e.g. MRI) to guide reconstruction. However, obtaining reference imagery is often non-standard, as in high-throughput animal models like mouse histology. Others have proposed using anatomical atlases as guides, but have not accounted for the intrinsic nonlinear shape difference from atlas to subject. Our method addresses these limitations by jointly optimizing reconstruction informed by an atlas simultaneously with the nonlinear change of coordinates that encapsulates anatomical variation. This accounts for intrinsic shape differences and enables rigorous, direct comparisons of atlas and subject coordinates.

Because explanations are given on an individual sequence basis and can vary substantially across sequences, deducing generalizable trends across the dataset and quantifying their effect size remains a challenge. Here we introduce global importance analysis (GIA), a model interpretability method that quantifies the population-level effect size that putative patterns have on model predictions.

As a case study, we demonstrate the utility of GIA on the computational task of predicting RNA-protein interactions from sequence. We first introduce a convolutional network, we call ResidualBind, and benchmark its performance against previous methods on RNAcompete data. Using GIA, we then demonstrate that in addition to sequence motifs, ResidualBind learns a model that considers the number of motifs, their spacing, and sequence context, such as RNA secondary structure and GC-bias.', 'Although deep neural networks are becoming widely applied in genomics, it remains unclear why they make a given prediction.

The routing backbone of the trail networks of arboreal turtle ants (', ') connects many nests and food sources using trail pheromone deposited by ants as they walk. Unlike species that forage on the ground, the trail networks of arboreal ants are constrained by the vegetation. We examined what objectives the trail networks meet by comparing the observed ant trail networks with networks of random, hypothetical trail networks in the same surrounding vegetation and with trails optimized for four objectives: minimizing path length, minimizing average edge length, minimizing number of nodes, and minimizing opportunities to get lost. The ants’ trails minimized path length by minimizing the number of nodes traversed rather than choosing short edges. In addition, the ants’ trails reduced the opportunity for ants to get lost at each node, favoring nodes with 3D configurations most likely to be reinforced by pheromone. Thus, rather than finding the shortest edges, turtle ant trail networks take advantage of natural variation in the environment to favor coherence, keeping the ants together on the trails.', 'We investigated the trail networks of arboreal turtle ants in the canopy of the tropical forest, to ask what characterizes the colony’s choice of foraging paths within the vegetation. We monitored day to day changes in the junctions and edges of trail networks of colonies in the dry forest of western Mexico. We compared the paths used by the ants to simulated random paths in the surrounding vegetation. We found that the paths of turtle ants prioritize coherence, keeping ants together on the trail, over minimizing the average edge length. The choice of paths reduces the number of junctions in the trail where ants could get lost, and favors junctions with a physical configuration that makes it likely that successive ants will reinforce the same path.

We used the transparent nematode, ', ', with its small nervous system to define neural network features associated with various chemosensory stimuli. We first immobilized animals using a microfluidic device and exposed their noses to chemical stimuli while monitoring changes in neural activity of more than 50 neurons in the head region. We found that graph-theoretic features, which capture patterns of interactions between neurons, are modulated by stimulus identity. Further, we show that a simple machine learning classifier trained using graph-theoretic features alone, or in combination with neural activity features, can accurately predict salt stimulus. Moreover, by focusing on putative causal interactions between neurons, the graph-theoretic features were almost twice as predictive as the neural activity features. These results reveal that stimulus identity modulates the broad, network-level organization of the nervous system, and that graph theory can be used to characterize these changes.', 'Animals use their nervous systems to detect and respond to changes in their external environment.

By measuring the statistical enrichment of twenty-five UniProt features in 981 IDRs of 561 human proteins, we identified eight features that are commonly located in IDRs.

We reanalyse published neuronal traces to demonstrate that our local geometry approach enables to better characterize a neuron’s morphology, with direct relevance to understanding its development and function.

However, previous scans have been limited in power and accuracy owing to small numbers of available genomes. Here we present the most comprehensive examination of mammalian PSGs to date, using the six high-coverage genome assemblies now available for eutherian mammals. The increased phylogenetic depth of this dataset results in substantially improved statistical power, and permits several new lineage- and clade-specific tests to be applied. Of ∼16,500 human genes with high-confidence orthologs in at least two other species, 400 genes showed significant evidence of positive selection (FDR<0.05), according to a standard likelihood ratio test. An additional 144 genes showed evidence of positive selection on particular lineages or clades. As in previous studies, the identified PSGs were enriched for roles in defense/immunity, chemosensory perception, and reproduction, but enrichments were also evident for more specific functions, such as complement-mediated immunity and taste perception. Several pathways were strongly enriched for PSGs, suggesting possible co-evolution of interacting genes. A novel Bayesian analysis of the possible “selection histories” of each gene indicated that most PSGs have switched multiple times between positive selection and nonselection, suggesting that positive selection is often episodic. A detailed analysis of Affymetrix exon array data indicated that PSGs are expressed at significantly lower levels, and in a more tissue-specific manner, than non-PSGs. Genes that are specifically expressed in the spleen, testes, liver, and breast are significantly enriched for PSGs, but no evidence was found for an enrichment for PSGs among brain-specific genes. This study provides additional evidence for widespread positive selection in mammalian evolution and new genome-wide insights into the functional implications of positive selection.', 'Populations evolve as mutations arise in individual organisms and, through hereditary transmission, gradually become “fixed” (shared by all individuals) in the population. Many mutations have essentially no effect on organismal fitness and can become fixed only by the stochastic process of neutral drift. However, some mutations produce a selective advantage that boosts their chances of reaching fixation. Genes in which new mutations tend to be beneficial, rather than neutral or deleterious, tend to evolve rapidly and are said to be under positive selection. Genes involved in immunity and defense are a well-known example; rapid evolution in these genes presumably occurs because new mutations help organisms to prevail in evolutionary “arms races” with pathogens. Many mammalian genes show evidence of positive selection, but open questions remain about the overall impact of positive selection in mammals. For example, which key differences between species can be attributed to positive selection? How have patterns of selection changed across the mammalian phylogeny? What are the effects of population size and gene expression patterns on positive selection? Here we attempt to shed light on these and other questions in a comprehensive study of ∼16,500 genes in six mammalian genomes.']",['Not applicable 1075'],[]

However, how these pathways are regulated is not well understood. Here we report an interaction between the Elongator histone acetyltransferase and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen.

It is believed that the DNA replication-coupled nucleosome assembly process plays an important role in such inheritance as well as maintenance of genome stability. In this process, histone chaperones such as chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) deposit newly synthesized histones H3–H4, which are acetylated at specific lysine residues, onto replicating DNA in a PCNA dependent reaction.

For this purpose, we constructed a genome-wide, high-resolution optical map of the maize inbred line B73 genome containing >91,000 restriction sites (averaging 1 site/∼23 kb) accrued from mapping genomic DNA molecules. Our optical map comprises 66 contigs, averaging 31.88 Mb in size and spanning 91.5% (2,103.93 Mb/∼2,300 Mb) of the maize genome.

The alignment of optical maps against numerous data sources yielded comprehensive results that proved revealing and productive. For example, gaps were uncovered and characterized within the iMap, the FPC (fingerprinted contigs) map, and the chromosome-wide pseudomolecules. Such alignments also suggested amended placements of FPC contigs on the maize genetic map and proactively guided the assembly of chromosome-wide pseudomolecules, especially within complex genomic regions.

For 25 families, expression was verified by deep-sequencing of small RNA libraries that were prepared from an assortment of maize tissues. PCR–RACE amplification of 68 miRNA transcript precursors, representing 18 families conserved across several plant species, showed that splice variation and the use of alternative transcriptional start and stop sites is common within this class of genes. Comparison of sequence variation data from diverse maize inbred lines versus teosinte accessions suggest that the mature miRNAs are under strong purifying selection while the flanking sequences evolve equivalently to other genes. Since maize is derived from an ancient tetraploid, the effect of whole-genome duplication on miRNA evolution was examined. We found that, like protein-coding genes, duplicated miRNA genes underwent extensive gene-loss, with ∼35% of ancestral sites retained as duplicate homoeologous miRNA genes. This number is higher than that observed with protein-coding genes. A search for putative miRNA targets indicated bias towards genes in regulatory and metabolic pathways.

The similarity of the replication profiles for early and mid S phase cells indicates that replication origin activation in euchromatin is stochastic. Replicon organization in ', ' is strongly influenced by epigenetic modifications to histones and DNA. The domain organization of ', ' is more similar to that in ', ' than that in mammals, which may reflect genome size and complexity. The distinct patterns of association of H3K56ac with gene expression and early replication provide evidence that H3K56ac may be associated with initiation zones and replication origins.', 'During growth and development, all plants and animals must replicate their DNA. This process is regulated to ensure that all sequences are completely and accurately replicated and is limited to S phase of the cell cycle. In the cell, DNA is packaged with histone proteins into chromatin, and both DNA and histones are subject to epigenetic modifications that affect chromatin state. Euchromatin and heterochromatin are chromatin states marked by epigenetic modifications specifying open and closed conformations, respectively. Using the model plant ', ', we show that the time at which a DNA sequence replicates is influenced by the epigenetic modifications to the surrounding chromatin. DNA replication occurs in two phases, with euchromatin replicating in early and mid S phase and heterochromatin replicating late. DNA replication time has been linked to gene expression in other organisms, and this is also true in ', ' because more genes are active in euchromatin when compared to heterochromatin. The earliest replicating DNA sequences are associated with acetylation of histone H3 on lysine 56 (H3K56ac). H3K56ac is also abundant in active genes, but the patterns of association of H3K56ac with gene expression and DNA replication are distinct, suggesting that H3K56ac is independently linked to both processes.']",['Not applicable 1087'],[]

In spite of numerous studies, the relative contributions of the various heterochromatic histone marks to the properties of heterochromatin remain largely undefined. Here, we report that silencing of the fission yeast mating-type cassettes, which are located in a well-characterized heterochromatic region, is hardly affected in cells lacking the H3K9 methyltransferase Clr4. We document the existence of a pathway parallel to H3K9me ensuring gene repression in the absence of Clr4 and identify a silencing factor central to this pathway, Clr5. We find that Clr5 controls gene expression at multiple chromosomal locations in addition to affecting the mating-type region. The histone deacetylase Clr6 acts in the same pathway as Clr5, at least for its effects in the mating-type region, and on a subset of other targets, notably a region recently found to be prone to neo-centromere formation. The genomic targets of Clr5 also include Ste11, a master regulator of sexual differentiation. Hence Clr5, like the multi-functional Atf1 transcription factor which also modulates chromatin structure in the mating-type region, controls sexual differentiation and genome integrity at several levels. Globally, our results point to histone deacetylases as prominent repressors of gene expression in fission yeast heterochromatin. These deacetylases can act in concert with, or independently of, the widely studied H3K9me mark to influence gene silencing at heterochromatic loci.', 'In eukaryotes some histone modifications are preponderantly associated with silent chromosomal domains, however the extent to which distinct modifications contribute to the silencing of gene expression is often not known. A well-studied chromosomal domain in which histone modifications have been extensively characterized is the fission yeast mating-type region.

Contrary to a general assumption, we found that genes naturally present in the mating-type region of wild-type strains remain repressed in the absence of the H3K9 methyltransferase Clr4. Their repression depends on histone deacetylases and on a hitherto uncharacterized factor, Clr5. Our results reveal an unsuspected robustness in the silencing mechanism, where H3K9me and deacetylation cooperate to ensure that the genes naturally present in the mating-type region remain silent in conditions where their expression would otherwise kill the cells.']",['Not applicable 1088'],[]

The gBGC tracts provide a unique window into historical recombination processes along the human and chimpanzee lineages.

Specifically, fibroblast-secreted amphiregulin promoted breast cancer cell survival, whereas the chemokine ', ' stimulated tumor cell proliferation while ', ' promoted innate immune cell infiltration and angiogenesis. The other two factors tested had minor (', ') or minimally (', ') significant effects on the ability of fibroblasts to promote tumor growth. The importance of parallel interactions between fibroblasts and cancer cells was tested by simultaneously targeting fibroblast-secreted amphiregulin and the ', ' receptor on cancer cells, and this was significantly more efficacious than blocking either pathway alone. We further explored the concept of parallel interactions by testing the extent to which induction of critical fibroblast-secreted proteins could be achieved by single, previously identified, factors produced by breast cancer cells. We found that although single factors could induce a subset of genes, even combinations of factors failed to induce the full repertoire of functionally important fibroblast-secreted proteins. Together, these results delineate a complex network of tumor-fibroblast interactions that act in parallel to promote tumorigenicity and suggest that effective anti-stromal therapeutic strategies will need to be multi-targeted.', 'There is increasing interest in developing methods to treat cancer by targeting non-cancer cells that play supportive roles in the tumor microenvironment. One type of non-cancer cell that has received considerable attention along these lines is cancer-associated fibroblasts, which can promote tumor formation and tumor growth. There have been several studies showing that inhibition of individual fibroblast genes or proteins dramatically reduces the tumor supportive function of fibroblasts. From the perspective of developing a therapeutic strategy, what remains unclear is whether the several different important factors discovered to date reflect the requirement of a multitude of fibroblast factors to promote tumorigenicity, or whether it reflects the diversity of the epithelial cancer cells and fibroblasts used in these different studies. Here, we addressed this question directly using a single system of fibroblasts and breast cancer epithelial cells. Importantly, we found that a multitude of fibroblast factors are indeed required to promote tumorigenicity, and that they have different effects on the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, we found that inhibiting multiple fibroblast-secreted factors is more efficacious than blocking individual factors.

Analysis of these sequences supports a demographic model in which dogs and wolves diverged through a dynamic process involving population bottlenecks in both lineages and post-divergence gene flow. In dogs, the domestication bottleneck involved at least a 16-fold reduction in population size, a much more severe bottleneck than estimated previously. A sharp bottleneck in wolves occurred soon after their divergence from dogs, implying that the pool of diversity from which dogs arose was substantially larger than represented by modern wolf populations. We narrow the plausible range for the date of initial dog domestication to an interval spanning 11–16 thousand years ago, predating the rise of agriculture. In light of this finding, we expand upon previous work regarding the increase in copy number of the amylase gene (', ') in dogs, which is believed to have aided digestion of starch in agricultural refuse. We find standing variation for amylase copy number variation in wolves and little or no copy number increase in the Dingo and Husky lineages. In conjunction with the estimated timing of dog origins, these results provide additional support to archaeological finds, suggesting the earliest dogs arose alongside hunter-gathers rather than agriculturists. Regarding the geographic origin of dogs, we find that, surprisingly, none of the extant wolf lineages from putative domestication centers is more closely related to dogs, and, instead, the sampled wolves form a sister monophyletic clade. This result, in combination with dog-wolf admixture during the process of domestication, suggests that a re-evaluation of past hypotheses regarding dog origins is necessary.', 'The process of dog domestication is still poorly understood, largely because no studies thus far have leveraged deeply sequenced whole genomes from wolves and dogs to simultaneously evaluate support for the proposed source regions: East Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. To investigate dog origins, we sequence three wolf genomes from the putative centers of origin, two basal dog breeds (Basenji and Dingo), and a golden jackal as an outgroup. We find that none of the wolf lineages from the hypothesized domestication centers is supported as the source lineage for dogs, and that dogs and wolves diverged 11,000–16,000 years ago in a process involving extensive admixture and that was followed by a bottleneck in wolves.

Especially controversial is a model called “overdominance,” which states in its simplest form that a single gene can drive heterosis, although multiple overdominant genes can also contribute. In tomato, a mutation in just one of two copies of a gene encoding the flowering hormone called florigen causes remarkable increases in yield, but it is not known why. We show that yield increases are triggered by a fine-tuning of florigen levels that cause subtle delays in the time it takes all shoots to produce flowers. The resulting plant architecture maximizes yield in varieties that dominate the processing tomato industry.

In addition, the insulator factor BEAF, the BEAF-interacting protein Chriz, and the transcription factor M1BP are strikingly enriched on those GAF-associated genes where pausing is unaffected by knock down, suggesting insulators or the alternative promoter-associated factor M1BP protect a subset of GAF-bound paused genes from GAF knock-down effects. Thus, GAF binding at promoters can lead to the local displacement of nucleosomes, but this activity can be restricted or compensated for when insulator protein or M1BP complexes also reside at GAF bound promoters.', 'Transcriptional regulation is critical for proper gene expression in response to environmental changes and developmental programs. Eukaryotes have evolved multiple mechanisms by which transcription factors regulate transcription. One mechanism is the reorganization of chromatin to allow Pol II recruitment. Another is the release of promoter-proximal paused Pol II, where Pol II transcription that is halted 20–60 bases downstream of the transcription start site (TSS) is allowed to enter into productive elongation through the gene body. The Drosophila transcription factor GAF binds to genes that undergo pausing and interacts with nucleosome remodelers and the pausing factor NELF. Thus, GAF can regulate multiple points necessary for transcription, but its mechanistic role is not fully understood genome-wide. We depleted GAF from cells and examined the genome-wide changes in Pol II and nucleosome distributions across genes. We found that GAF depletion reduces polymerase density at genes where GAF binds just upstream of the TSS, and results in nucleosomes moving into the promoter region. Our results show that GAF is important for maintaining the promoter accessibility, allowing Pol II to be recruited to promoters and enter the pause sites downstream of the TSS. Thus, GAF is critical for providing the chromatin environment necessary for the proper control of gene expression.']",['The genomic data in this work is deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus under the accession numbers: GSE58957 and GSE40646.'],[]

To do so, we conduct a selection scan using three wolf genomes representing the putative centers of dog domestication, two basal dog breeds (Basenji and Dingo), and a golden jackal as outgroup, for which we previously inferred a demographic model.

Together, our findings indicate that Epe1 is involved in both maintenance and alteration of heterochromatin distribution, and shed light on the mechanisms controlling individual-specific epigenome profiles.']","['The sequences of the probes and the original data from the microarray experiments were deposited in GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) under accession number GSE108448.

To investigate DNA replication programs in these two types of cell cycles, we pulse labeled intact root tips of maize (', ') with 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU) and used flow sorting of nuclei to examine DNA replication timing (RT) during the transition from a mitotic cycle to an endocycle. Comparison of the sequence-based RT profiles showed that most regions of the maize genome replicate at the same time during S phase in mitotic and endocycling cells, despite the need to replicate twice as much DNA in the endocycle and the fact that endocycling is typically associated with cell differentiation. However, regions collectively corresponding to 2% of the genome displayed significant changes in timing between the two types of cell cycles. The majority of these regions are small with a median size of 135 kb, shift to a later RT in the endocycle, and are enriched for genes expressed in the root tip. We found larger regions that shifted RT in centromeres of seven of the ten maize chromosomes. These regions covered the majority of the previously defined functional centromere, which ranged between 1 and 2 Mb in size in the reference genome. They replicate mainly during mid S phase in mitotic cells but primarily in late S phase of the endocycle. In contrast, the immediately adjacent pericentromere sequences are primarily late replicating in both cell cycles. Analysis of CENH3 enrichment levels in 8C vs 2C nuclei suggested that there is only a partial replacement of CENH3 nucleosomes after endocycle replication is complete. The shift to later replication of centromeres and possible reduction in CENH3 enrichment after endocycle replication is consistent with a hypothesis that centromeres are inactivated when their function is no longer needed.', 'In traditional cell division, or mitosis, a cell’s genetic material is duplicated and then split between two daughter cells. In contrast, in some specialized cell types, the DNA is duplicated a second time without an intervening division step, resulting in cells that carry twice as much DNA. This phenomenon, which is called the endocycle, is common during plant development. At each step, DNA replication follows an ordered program in which highly compacted DNA is unraveled and replicated in sections at different times during the synthesis (S) phase. In plants, it is unclear whether traditional and endocycle programs are the same, especially since endocycling cells are typically in the process of differentiation. Using root tips of maize, we found that in comparison to replication in the mitotic cell cycle, there is a small portion of the genome whose replication in the endocycle is shifted in time, usually to later in S phase. Some of these regions are scattered around the genome and mostly coincide with active genes. However, the most prominent shifts occur in centromeres. The shift to later replication in centromeres is noteworthy because they orchestrate the process of separating duplicated chromosomes into daughter cells, a function that is not needed in the endocycle.']",['The raw sequencing data for this project have been deposited at the NCBI under the umbrella project number PRJNA335625.

In our study, we prove theorems that show that such a transfer of network connectivity is theoretically possible.', 'The connections between neurons determine the computations performed by both artificial and biological neural networks.

SYNSeq addresses the analysis problem, reducing a network into a suspension of barcode pairs. Here, we formulate a complementary synthesis problem: How can the suspension of barcode pairs be used to “clone” or copy the network back into an uninitialized tabula rasa network? Although this synthesis problem might be expected to be computationally intractable, we find that, surprisingly, this problem can be solved efficiently, using only neuron-local information. We present the “one-barcode–one-cell” (OBOC) algorithm, which forces all barcodes of a given sequence to coalesce into the same neuron, and show that it converges in a number of steps that is a power law of the network size.

Later, the double hexamer recruits Cdc45 and GINS to form two active and separate DNA helicases. The active Cdc45–Mcm2-7–GINS helicase encircles the leading strand while excluding the lagging strand. One of the fundamental unanswered questions is how each Mcm2-7 hexamer converts from binding dsDNA to binding one of the single strands. The structure of the double hexamer on dsDNA reveals how DNA interacts with key elements inside the central channel, leading us to propose a lagging-strand extrusion mechanism. This work advances our understanding of eukaryotic replication initiation.', 'During replication initiation, the core component of the helicase—the Mcm2-7 hexamer—is loaded on origin DNA as a double hexamer (DH). The two ring-shaped hexamers are staggered, leading to a kinked axial channel. How the origin DNA interacts with the axial channel is not understood, but the interaction could provide key insights into Mcm2-7 function and regulation. Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of the Mcm2-7 DH on dsDNA and show that the DNA is zigzagged inside the central channel. Several of the Mcm subunit DNA-binding loops, such as the oligosaccharide–oligonucleotide loops, helix 2 insertion loops, and presensor 1 (PS1) loops, are well defined, and many of them interact extensively with the DNA. The PS1 loops of Mcm 3, 4, 6, and 7, but not 2 and 5, engage the lagging strand with an approximate step size of one base per subunit. Staggered coupling of the two opposing hexamers positions the DNA right in front of the two Mcm2–Mcm5 gates, with each strand being pressed against one gate. The architecture suggests that lagging-strand extrusion initiates in the middle of the DH that is composed of the zinc finger domains of both hexamers. To convert the Mcm2-7 DH structure into the Mcm2-7 hexamer structure found in the active helicase, the N-tier ring of the Mcm2-7 hexamer in the DH-dsDNA needs to tilt and shift laterally. We suggest that these N-tier ring movements cause the DNA strand separation and lagging-strand extrusion.']",['The cryo-EM 3D map of double hexamer-dsDNA at 3.9 Å resolution has been deposited at the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) database (accession no.

This correlation is not explained by a correlation between IQ and motor skills. We find that IQ and motor skills are distinctly associated with damaging mutations and, in particular, that motor skills are a more sensitive indicator of mutational severity than is IQ, as judged by mutational type and target gene.

From the perfect matches, a representation of the read coverage per nucleotide along the genome, the variation landscape, is generated. SNVs are then pinpointed as significant changes in coverage and de novo SNVs can be identified with high precision. The performance of COBASI was analyzed using simulations and experimentally validated by sequencing de novo SNVs identified from a parent–offspring trio. We propose this pipeline as a useful tool for different genomic applications.', 'The precise determination of de novo genetic variants has enormous implications across different fields of biology and medicine, particularly personalized medicine. Currently, de novo variations are identified by mapping sample reads from a parent–offspring trio to a reference genome, allowing for a certain degree of differences.

In a previous study, we developed an alternative approach to accurately identify single nucleotide variants (SNVs) using only perfect matches.

COBASI identifies SNVs using changes in coverage of exactly matching unique substrings, and is particularly suited for pinpointing de novo SNVs. Unlike other approaches that require population frequencies across hundreds of samples to filter out any methodological biases, COBASI can be applied to detect de novo SNVs within isolated families. We demonstrate this capability through extensive simulation studies and by studying a parent–offspring trio we sequenced using short reads.

Whether some genes are more likely to be differentially expressed than others, and to what degree, has never been assessed on a global scale. Here, we reanalyze more than 600 studies and find that knowledge of a gene’s prior probability of differential expression (DE) allows for accurate prediction of DE hit lists, regardless of the biological question. This result suggests redundancy in transcriptomics experiments that both informs gene set interpretation and highlights room for growth within the field.', 'Differential expression (DE) is commonly used to explore molecular mechanisms of biological conditions. While many studies report significant results between their groups of interest, the degree to which results are specific to the question at hand is not generally assessed, potentially leading to inaccurate interpretation. This could be particularly problematic for metaanalysis where replicability across datasets is taken as strong evidence for the existence of a specific, biologically relevant signal, but which instead may arise from recurrence of generic processes. To address this, we developed an approach to predict DE based on an analysis of over 600 studies. A predictor based on empirical prior probability of DE performs very well at this task (mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, ∼0.8), indicating that a large fraction of DE hit lists are nonspecific. In contrast, predictors based on attributes such as gene function, mutation rates, or network features perform poorly.

Here, we establish that, at sites of TLS establishment, resident fibroblasts expand and acquire immunological features in a process that is dependent on IL13 and IL22.

This program of events, that precedes lymphocyte infiltration in the tissue, is mediated by paracrine and autocrine signals mainly regulated by IL13. This initial fibroblast network is expanded and stabilized, once lymphocytes are recruited, by the local production of the cytokines IL22 and lymphotoxin.

In many cases, such as vegetation or bacterial biofilms, dense surface-bound populations compete for both resources and physical space. How do these territorial interactions impact ecosystem behavior and biodiversity? We study a theoretical model of territorial resource competition with trade-offs and show that many features of real ecosystems emerge naturally, including slow population dynamics that render community composition susceptible to demographic and other noise. We also observe alternate steady states, including the Allee effect in which survival requires a minimum population. Importantly, we demonstrate that biodiversity occurs robustly and can arise in territorial communities simply due to competition for resources.', 'Many ecosystems, from vegetation to biofilms, are composed of territorial populations that compete for both nutrients and physical space. What are the implications of such spatial organization for biodiversity? To address this question, we developed and analyzed a model of territorial resource competition. In the model, all species obey trade-offs inspired by biophysical constraints on metabolism; the species occupy nonoverlapping territories, while nutrients diffuse in space. We find that the nutrient diffusion time is an important control parameter for both biodiversity and the timescale of population dynamics. Interestingly, fast nutrient diffusion allows the populations of some species to fluctuate to zero, leading to extinctions. Moreover, territorial competition spontaneously gives rise to both multistability and the Allee effect (in which a minimum population is required for survival), so that small perturbations can have major ecological effects. While the assumption of trade-offs allows for the coexistence of more species than the number of nutrients—thus violating the principle of competitive exclusion—overall biodiversity is curbed by the domination of “oligotroph” species. Importantly, in contrast to well-mixed models, spatial structure renders diversity robust to inequalities in metabolic trade-offs. Our results suggest that territorial ecosystems can display high biodiversity and rich dynamics simply due to competition for resources in a spatial community.']",['The code used in this paper has been deposited in GitHub (https://github.com/BenjaminWeiner/ecology-territorial-populations).'],['https://github.com/BenjaminWeiner/ecology-territorial-populations']

Using genetic variant data from across the human genome, we find evidence that selection increases with the length of the unbroken hydrophobic sequence. These results could lead to improvements in a wide range of genomic tools as well as insights into protein-aggregation disease etiology and protein evolutionary history.', 'Hydrophobic interactions have long been established as essential for stabilizing structured proteins as well as drivers of aggregation, but the impact of hydrophobicity on the functional significance of sequence variants has rarely been considered in a genome-wide context.

We find that functional impact is uncorrelated with hydrophobicity of the SNP itself and only weakly correlated with the average local hydrophobicity, but is strongly correlated with both the size and minimum hydrophobicity of the contiguously hydrophobic sequence (or “blob”) that contains the SNP. Disease association is found to vary by more than sixfold as a function of contiguous hydrophobicity parameters, suggesting utility as a prior for identifying causal variation. We further find signatures of differential selective constraint on hydrophobic blobs and that SNPs splitting a long hydrophobic blob or joining two short hydrophobic blobs are particularly likely to be disease associated.

Understanding this mapping is often challenging because of interactions between mutations, where the result of combining several different mutations can be very different than the sum of their individual effects. Here we provide a statistical framework for modeling complex genetic interactions of this type. The key idea is to ask how fast the effects of mutations change when introducing the same mutation in increasingly distant genetic backgrounds. We then propose a model for phenotypic prediction that takes into account this tendency for the effects of mutations to be more similar in nearby genetic backgrounds.', 'Contemporary high-throughput mutagenesis experiments are providing an increasingly detailed view of the complex patterns of genetic interaction that occur between multiple mutations within a single protein or regulatory element. By simultaneously measuring the effects of thousands of combinations of mutations, these experiments have revealed that the genotype–phenotype relationship typically reflects not only genetic interactions between pairs of sites but also higher-order interactions among larger numbers of sites. However, modeling and understanding these higher-order interactions remains challenging. Here we present a method for reconstructing sequence-to-function mappings from partially observed data that can accommodate all orders of genetic interaction. The main idea is to make predictions for unobserved genotypes that match the type and extent of epistasis found in the observed data. This information on the type and extent of epistasis can be extracted by considering how phenotypic correlations change as a function of mutational distance, which is equivalent to estimating the fraction of phenotypic variance due to each order of genetic interaction (additive, pairwise, three-way, etc.). Using these estimated variance components, we then define an empirical Bayes prior that in expectation matches the observed pattern of epistasis and reconstruct the genotype–phenotype mapping by conducting Gaussian process regression under this prior. To demonstrate the power of this approach, we present an application to the antibody-binding domain GB1 and also provide a detailed exploration of a dataset consisting of high-throughput measurements for the splicing efficiency of human pre-mRNA ', ' splice sites, for which we also validate our model predictions via additional low-throughput experiments.']","['A Python command-line interface, vcregression, that implements the empirical variance component regression method described here has been deposited in GitHub (https://github.com/davidmccandlish/vcregression) (87), together with the other scripts necessary to replicate the results presented here.

Fluorescent labeling was sufficient to visualize neuronal structures with synaptic resolution in vivo, and ChR2 expression allowed light activation of neuronal spiking. The structural dynamics of a specific class of neocortical neuron, the parvalbumin-containing (Pv) fast-spiking GABAergic interneuron, was monitored over the course of a week.

Our results indicate that Pv inhibitory circuits maintain the potential for structural re-wiring in post-adolescent cortex.

Previous attempts to reconcile neuroanatomical nomenclatures have been largely qualitative, focusing on the development of thesauri or simple semantic mappings between terms. Here we take a fundamentally different approach, discounting the names of regions and instead comparing their definitions as spatial entities in an effort to provide more precise quantitative mappings between anatomical entities as defined by different atlases. We develop an analytical framework for studying this brain atlas concordance problem, and apply these methods in a comparison of eight diverse labeling methods used by the neuroimaging community. These analyses result in conditional probabilities that enable mapping between regions across atlases, which also form the input to graph-based methods for extracting higher-order relationships between sets of regions and to procedures for assessing the global similarity between different parcellations of the same brain. At a global scale, the overall results demonstrate a considerable lack of concordance between available parcellation schemes, falling within chance levels for some atlas pairs. At a finer level, this study reveals spatial relationships between sets of defined regions that are not obviously apparent; these are of high potential interest to researchers faced with the challenge of comparing results that were based on these different anatomical models, particularly when coordinate-based data are not available.

Such differences in network architecture have been reported both at rest and during cognitive task performance, but an open question is whether these age-related differences show task-dependent effects or represent only task-independent changes attributable to a common factor (i.e., underlying physiological decline). To address this question, we used graph theoretic analysis to construct weighted cortical functional networks from hemodynamic (functional MRI) responses in 12 younger and 12 older adults during a speech perception task performed in both quiet and noisy listening conditions. Functional networks were constructed for each subject and listening condition based on inter-regional correlations of the fMRI signal among 66 cortical regions, and network measures of global and local efficiency were computed. Across listening conditions, older adult networks showed significantly decreased global (but not local) efficiency relative to younger adults after normalizing measures to surrogate random networks. Although listening condition produced no main effects on whole-cortex network organization, a significant age group x listening condition interaction was observed. Additionally, an exploratory analysis of regional effects uncovered age-related declines in both global and local efficiency concentrated exclusively in auditory areas (bilateral superior and middle temporal cortex), further suggestive of specificity to the speech perception tasks. Global efficiency also correlated positively with mean cortical thickness across all subjects, establishing gross cortical atrophy as a task-independent contributor to age-related differences in functional organization. Together, our findings provide evidence of age-related disruptions in cortical functional network organization during speech perception tasks, and suggest that although task-independent effects such as cortical atrophy clearly underlie age-related changes in cortical functional organization, age-related differences also demonstrate sensitivity to task domains.']",['Not applicable 1193'],[]

While this error rate is fairly modest, sequencing error can still have surprising effects. For example, an apparent lineage-specific insertion in a coding region is more likely to reflect sequencing error than a true biological event, and the length distribution of coding indels is strongly distorted by error. We find that most errors are contributed by a small fraction of bases with low quality scores, in particular, by the ends of reads in regions of single-read coverage in the assembly. We explore several approaches for automatic sequencing error mitigation (SEM), making use of the localized nature of sequencing error, the fact that it is well predicted by quality scores, and information about errors that comes from comparisons across species.

In this paper we show that multifunctionality, rather than association, is a primary driver of gene function prediction. We first show that knowledge of the degree of multifunctionality alone can produce astonishingly strong performance when used as a predictor of gene function. We then demonstrate how multifunctionality is encoded in gene interaction data (such as protein interactions and coexpression networks) and how this can feed forward into gene function prediction algorithms. We find that high-quality gene function predictions can be made using data that possesses no information on which gene interacts with which. By examining a wide range of networks from mouse, human and yeast, as well as multiple prediction methods and evaluation metrics, we provide evidence that this problem is pervasive and does not reflect the failings of any particular algorithm or data type. We propose computational controls that can be used to provide more meaningful control when estimating gene function prediction performance. We suggest that this source of bias due to multifunctionality is important to control for, with widespread implications for the interpretation of genomics studies.']",['Not applicable 1196'],[]

The superior colliculus (SC), which receives multiple inputs from different sensory modalities, is considered to be involved in the initiation of motor responses. However, the mechanism by which multisensory information facilitates motor responses is not yet understood. Here, we demonstrate that multisensory information modulates competition among SC neurons to elicit faster responses. We conducted multiunit recordings from the SC of rats performing a two-alternative spatial discrimination task using auditory and/or visual stimuli. We found that a large population of SC neurons showed direction-selective activity before the onset of movement in response to the stimuli irrespective of stimulation modality. Trial-by-trial correlation analysis showed that the premovement activity of many SC neurons increased with faster reaction speed for the contraversive movement, whereas the premovement activity of another population of neurons decreased with faster reaction speed for the ipsiversive movement. When visual and auditory stimuli were presented simultaneously, the premovement activity of a population of neurons for the contraversive movement was enhanced, whereas the premovement activity of another population of neurons for the ipsiversive movement was depressed. Unilateral inactivation of SC using muscimol prolonged reaction times of contraversive movements, but it shortened those of ipsiversive movements. These findings suggest that the difference in activity between the SC hemispheres regulates the reaction speed of motor responses, and multisensory information enlarges the activity difference resulting in faster responses.']",['Not applicable 1198'],[]

We were specifically interested in copy number variation as our base genomic property in the prediction of tumor suppressors and oncogenes in the altered ovarian tumor. We therefore identify changes in DNA methylation and expression for all amplified and deleted genes. We statistically define tumor suppressor and oncogenic features for these modalities and perform a correlation analysis with expression. We predicted 611 potential oncogenes and tumor suppressors candidates by integrating these data types. Genes with a strong correlation for methylation dependent expression changes exhibited at varying copy number aberrations include CDCA8, ATAD2, CDKN2A, RAB25, AURKA, BOP1 and EIF2C3.

We delivered subthreshold and suprathreshold stimuli at the soma and several sites on the apical dendrite, and injected inputs that mimic synaptic barrages at individual or distributed sites.

Inhibition of the ErbB2-Par6 pathway was sufficient to block ErbB2-induced invasion suggesting that two polarity hits may be needed for ErbB2 to promote invasion.

We observed the invasive behavior only when cells were plated on a stiff matrix (Matrigel/Collagen-1) and not when plated on a soft matrix (Matrigel alone).

Inhibition of Akt activity blocked the invasive behavior identifying a mechanism by which loss of polarity promotes invasion of epithelial cells.

The frequency with which an alteration occurs might reflect its ability to increase cancer cell growth, or alternatively, enhanced instability of a locus may increase the frequency with which it is found to be aberrant in tumors, regardless of oncogenic impact. Here we’ve addressed this on a genome-wide scale for cancer-associated focal deletions, which are known to pinpoint both tumor suppressor genes (tumor suppressors) and unstable loci. Based on DNA copy number analysis of over one-thousand human cancers representing ten different tumor types, we observed five loci with focal deletion frequencies above 5%, including the ', ' gene at 16p13.3 and the ', ' gene at 20p12.1. However, neither RNA expression nor functional studies support a tumor suppressor role for either gene. Further analyses suggest instead that these are sites of increased genomic instability and that they resemble common fragile sites (CFS). Genome-wide analysis revealed properties of CFS-like recurrent deletions that distinguish them from deletions affecting tumor suppressor genes, including their isolation at specific loci away from other genomic deletion sites, a considerably smaller deletion size, and dispersal throughout the affected locus rather than assembly at a common site of overlap. Additionally, CFS-like deletions have less impact on gene expression and are enriched in cell lines compared to primary tumors. We show that loci affected by CFS-like deletions are often distinct from known common fragile sites. Indeed, we find that each tumor tissue type has its own spectrum of CFS-like deletions, and that colon cancers have many more CFS-like deletions than other tumor types. We present simple rules that can pinpoint focal deletions that are not CFS-like and more likely to affect functional tumor suppressors.']",['Not applicable 1215'],[]

Our fundamental finding is that the angular interval between the direction a fly walks and the direction it faces is actively managed in intact animals and modulated in a patterned way with drugs. This interval is small in intact flies, larger with alcohol and much larger with cocaine. The dynamics of this interval generates six coordinative modes that flow smoothly into each other. Under alcohol and much more so under cocaine, straight path modes dwindle and modes involving rotation proliferate. To obtain these results we perform high content analysis of video-tracked open field locomotor behavior. Presently there is a gap between the quality of descriptions of insect behaviors that unfold in circumscribed situations, and descriptions that unfold in extended time and space. While the first describe the coordination between low-level kinematic variables, the second quantify cumulative measures and subjectively defined behavior patterns. Here we reduce this gap by phenotyping extended locomotor behavior in terms of the coordination between low-level kinematic variables, which we quantify, combining into a single field two disparate fields, that of high content phenotyping and that of locomotor coordination.

Inhibition of MAPK activity using a MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor reversed the inhibitory effect of WNT3 on GCP proliferation.

Recently, we revealed a novel role for Fkh1 and Fkh2 in the regulation of replication origin initiation timing, which, like donor preference in mating-type switching, appears to involve long-range chromosomal interactions, suggesting roles for Fkh1 and Fkh2 in chromatin architecture and organization. To elucidate how Fkh1 and Fkh2 regulate their target DNA elements and potentially regulate the spatial organization of the genome, we undertook a genome-wide analysis of Fkh1 and Fkh2 chromatin binding by ChIP-chip using tiling DNA microarrays.

BACE1 is elevated ∼2–3 fold in AD brain and is concentrated in dystrophic neurites near plaques, suggesting BACE1 elevation is Aβ−dependent. Previously, we showed that phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α de-represses translation of BACE1 mRNA following stress such as energy deprivation. We hypothesized that stress induced by Aβ might increase BACE1 levels by the same translational mechanism involving eIF2α phosphorylation. To test this hypothesis, we used three different genetic strategies to determine the effects of reducing eIF2α phosphorylation on Aβ-dependent BACE1 elevation in vitro and in vivo: 1) a two-vector adeno-associated virus (AAV) system to express constitutively active GADD34, the regulatory subunit of PP1c eIF2α phosphatase; 2) a non-phosphorylatable eIF2α S51A knockin mutation; 3) a BACE1-YFP transgene lacking the BACE1 mRNA 5′ untranslated region (UTR) required for eIF2α translational regulation. The first two strategies were used in primary neurons and 5XFAD transgenic mice, while the third strategy was employed only in 5XFAD mice. Despite very effective reduction of eIF2α phosphorylation in both primary neurons and 5XFAD brains, or elimination of eIF2α-mediated regulation of BACE1-YFP mRNA translation in 5XFAD brains, Aβ-dependent BACE1 elevation was not decreased. Additionally, robust inhibition of eIF2α phosphorylation did not block Aβ-dependent APP elevation in primary neurons, nor did it reduce amyloid pathology in 5XFAD mice. We conclude that amyloid-associated BACE1 elevation is not caused by translational de-repression via eIF2α phosphorylation, but instead appears to involve a post-translational mechanism. These definitive genetic results exclude a role for eIF2α phosphorylation in Aβ-dependent BACE1 and APP elevation. We suggest a vicious pathogenic cycle wherein Aβ42 toxicity induces peri-plaque BACE1 and APP accumulation in dystrophic neurites leading to exacerbated Aβ production and plaque progression.']",['The authors confirm that all data underlying the findings are fully available without restriction.

This concept was investigated in a patient with castrate-resistant prostate cancer progressing through both chemotherapy and targeted therapy. In this case study, we integrate across four timepoints 41 genome-wide copy number variation (CNV) profiles plus morphometric parameters and androgen receptor (AR) protein levels. Remarkably, little change was observed in response to standard chemotherapy, evidenced by the fact that a unique clone (A), exhibiting highly rearranged CNV profiles and AR+ phenotype was found circulating before and after treatment. However, clinical response and subsequent progression after targeted therapy was associated with the drastic depletion of clone A, followed by the sequential emergence of two distinct CTC sub-populations that differed in both AR genotype and expression phenotype. While AR- cells with flat or pseudo-diploid CNV profiles (clone B) were identified at the time of response, a new tumor lineage of AR+ cells (clone C) with CNV altered profiles was detected during relapse. We showed that clone C, despite phylogenetically related to clone A, possessed a unique set of somatic CNV alterations, including "", ' amplification, an event linked to hormone escape.

Here, we study the dynamical design of a well-characterized epigenetic chromatin switch: the yeast SIR system, in order to understand the origin of the stability of epigenetic states. We study hysteresis in this system by perturbing it with a histone deacetylase inhibitor. We find that SIR silencing has many characteristics of a non-linear bistable system, as observed in conventional genetic switches, which are based on activities of a few promoters affecting each other through the abundance of their gene products. Quite remarkably, our experiments in yeast telomeric silencing show a very distinctive pattern when it comes to the transition from bistability to monostability. In particular, the loss of the stable silenced state, upon increasing the inhibitor concentration, does not seem to show the expected saddle node behavior, instead looking like a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation. In other words, the ‘off’ state merges with the ‘on’ state at a threshold concentration leading to a single state, as opposed to the two states remaining distinct up to the threshold and exhibiting a discontinuous jump from the ‘off’ to the ‘on’ state. We argue that this is an inevitable consequence of silenced and active regions coexisting with dynamic domain boundaries. The experimental observations in our study therefore have broad implications for the understanding of chromatin silencing in yeast and beyond.']",['Not applicable 1237'],[]

One fundamental question is how best to compare neuron structures, for instance to organize and classify large collection of neurons. We aim to develop a flexible yet powerful framework to support comparison and classification of large collection of neuron structures efficiently. Specifically we propose to use a topological persistence-based feature vectorization framework. Existing methods to vectorize a neuron (i.e, convert a neuron to a feature vector so as to support efficient comparison and/or searching) typically rely on statistics or summaries of morphometric information, such as the average or maximum local torque angle or partition asymmetry. These simple summaries have limited power in encoding global tree structures. Based on the concept of topological persistence recently developed in the field of computational topology, we vectorize each neuron structure into a simple yet informative summary. In particular, each type of information of interest can be represented as a descriptor function defined on the neuron tree, which is then mapped to a simple persistence-signature. Our framework can encode both local and global tree structure, as well as other information of interest (electrophysiological or dynamical measures), by considering multiple descriptor functions on the neuron. The resulting persistence-based signature is potentially more informative than simple statistical summaries (such as average/mean/max) of morphometric quantities—Indeed, we show that using a certain descriptor function will give a persistence-based signature containing strictly more information than the classical Sholl analysis. At the same time, our framework retains the efficiency associated with treating neurons as points in a simple Euclidean feature space, which would be important for constructing efficient searching or indexing structures over them.

We investigated epididymal tissues of adult nestin-GFP mice, rats after Leydig cell depletion via ethane dimethane sulfonate (EDS), rats and mice during postnatal development and human tissues. By use of Clarity, a histochemical method to illustrate a three-dimensional picture, we could demonstrate nestin-GFP positive cells within the vascular network. We localized nestin in the epididymis in proliferating vascular SMCs by colocalization with both smooth muscle actin and PCNA, and it was distinct from CD31-positive endothelial cells. The same nestin localization was found in the human epididymis. However, nestin was not found in SMCs of the epididymal duct. Nestin expression is high during postnatal development of mouse and rat and down-regulated towards adulthood when testosterone levels increase. Nestin increases dramatically in rats after Leydig cell ablation with EDS and subsequently low testosterone levels. Interestingly, during this period, the expression of androgen receptor in the epididymis is low and increases until nestin reaches normal levels of adulthood. Here we show that nestin, a common marker for neuronal stem cells, is also expressed in the vasculature of the epididymis. Our results give new insights into the yet underestimated role of proliferating nestin-expressing vascular SMCs during postnatal development and repair of the epididymis.']",['All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.'],[]

This probably reflects the ability of Vpx to overcome an as yet uncharacterized block to an early event in the virus life cycle in these cells, but the underlying mechanism has remained elusive. Using biochemical and proteomic approaches, we have found that Vpx protein of the pathogenic SIVmac 239 strain associates with a ternary protein complex comprising DDB1 and VprBP subunits of Cullin 4–based E3 ubiquitin ligase, and DDA1, which has been implicated in the regulation of E3 catalytic activity, and that Vpx participates in the Cullin 4 E3 complex comprising VprBP. We further demonstrate that the ability of SIVmac as well as HIV-2 Vpx to interact with VprBP and its associated Cullin 4 complex is required for efficient reverse transcription of SIVmac RNA genome in primary macrophages. Strikingly, macrophages in which VprBP levels are depleted by RNA interference resist SIVmac infection. Thus, our observations reveal that Vpx interacts with both catalytic and regulatory components of the ubiquitin proteasome system and demonstrate that these interactions are critical for Vpx ability to enable efficient SIVmac replication in primary macrophages. Furthermore, they identify VprBP/DCAF1 substrate receptor for Cullin 4 E3 ubiquitin ligase and its associated protein complex as immediate downstream effector of Vpx for this function. Together, our findings suggest a model in which Vpx usurps VprBP-associated Cullin 4 ubiquitin ligase to enable efficient reverse transcription and thereby overcome a block to lentivirus replication in monocyte-derived cells, and thus provide novel insights into the underlying molecular mechanism.', 'Monocyte-derived tissue macrophages play crucial roles in infection by primate lentiviruses. Human and simian lentiviruses of the HIV-2 and SIVsm/mac lineages encode a virion-bound virulence factor termed Vpx. Vpx is required to establish infection specifically of monocyte-derived cells, but the underlying molecular mechanism is unclear. In this study we characterize how the replication of SIVmac is blocked in the absence of Vpx and how Vpx overcomes this block. We find that Vpx is required for efficient reverse transcription of the incoming RNA genome, suggesting that Vpx acts early following virion entry into the macrophage, probably on events linked to virion uncoating and/or reverse transcription. We also identified a Vpx-associated ternary protein complex that is the key mediator of Vpx function specifically in macrophages. This complex links Vpx to the cellular machinery that mediates protein ubiquitination and degradation. Together, we describe the immediate downstream effector, the molecular machinery and a tentative mechanism that lentiviral Vpx uses to enable reverse transcription in macrophages.

During biotrophic growth, the intracellularly growing hyphae are encased by the host plasma membrane. We show here that a small effector protein, which is secreted by fungal hyphae during penetration, is absolutely essential for fungal entry into plant cells. When this effector is absent, hyphal cells penetrate the plant cell wall and invagination of the plant plasma membrane is observed, but any further fungal development is arrested. This arrest coincides with the induction of massive plant defense responses. Thus, this effector, which is conserved in related fungal species, plays an essential role in suppression of plant defense responses and is critical for establishing compatibility. This is the first example where a single effector protein assumes such a crucial role for infection-related development in a plant pathogenic fungus.']",['Not applicable 1259'],[]

The Glioma-associated oncogene 1 (GLI1) is a key molecule in HH signaling, acting as a transcriptional effector and, moreover, is considered to be a potential therapeutic target for several types of cancer. To extend our previous focus on the implications of alternative splicing for HH signal transduction, we now report on an additional post-transcriptional mechanism with an impact on GLI1 activity, namely RNA editing. The GLI1 mRNA is highly edited at nucleotide 2179 by adenosine deamination in normal cerebellum, but the extent of this modification is reduced in cell lines from the cerebellar tumor medulloblastoma. Additionally, basal cell carcinoma tumor samples exhibit decreased GLI1 editing compared with normal skin. Interestingly, knocking down of either ADAR1 or ADAR2 reduces RNA editing of GLI1. This adenosine to inosine substitution leads to a change from Arginine to Glycine at position 701 that influences not only GLI1 transcriptional activity, but also GLI1-dependent cellular proliferation. Specifically, the edited GLI1, GLI1-701G, has a higher capacity to activate most of the transcriptional targets tested and is less susceptible to inhibition by the negative regulator of HH signaling suppressor of fused. However, the Dyrk1a kinase, implicated in cellular proliferation, is more effective in increasing the transcriptional activity of the non-edited GLI1. Finally, introduction of GLI1-701G into medulloblastoma cells confers a smaller increase in cellular growth relative to GLI1.

These rules support several goals of these systems, including optimizing efficiency (i.e. using all available resources); splitting resources fairly among cooperating agents, or conversely, acquiring resources quickly among competing agents; and minimizing the latency of responses, especially when conditions change.

We conclude that breast cancer cells successively substitute in a tumour mass, and the high reproduction of only a portion of cancer cells may confer high adaptability to this cancer.']",['The datasets supporting this article have been uploaded as part of the electronic supplementary material.

SeqMule integrates 5 alignment tools, 5 variant calling algorithms and accepts various combinations all by one-line command, therefore allowing highly flexible yet fully automated variant calling. In a modern machine (2 Intel Xeon X5650 CPUs, 48\u2009GB memory), when fast turn-around is needed, SeqMule generates annotated VCF files in a day from a 30X whole-genome sequencing data set; when more accurate calling is needed, SeqMule generates consensus call set that improves over single callers, as measured by both Mendelian error rate and consistency. SeqMule supports Sun Grid Engine for parallel processing, offers turn-key solution for deployment on Amazon Web Services, allows quality check, Mendelian error check, consistency evaluation, HTML-based reports.

Here, we review some key functions of ERV reprogramming during mouse and human development and discuss how small RNA-mediated silencing maintains genome stability when ERVs are temporarily released from heterochromatin repression. In particular, we take a closer look at the tRNA primer binding sites (PBS) of two highly active ERV families in mice and their sequence variation that is shaped by the conflict of successful tRNA priming for replication versus evasion of silencing by 3′-tRFs.']",['Not applicable 1307'],[]

We investigated whether a subpopulation of presumed inhibitory neurons in primary motor cortex (M1) might be involved in “gating” motor output during preparation, while permitting output during movement. This hypothesis predicts a release of inhibition just before movement onset. In data from M1 of two monkeys, we did not find evidence for this hypothesis: few neurons exhibited a clear pause during movement, and these were at the tail end of a broad distribution. We then identified a subpopulation likely to be enriched for inhibitory interneurons, using their waveform shapes. We found that the firing rates of this subpopulation tended to increase during movement instead of decreasing as predicted by the M1 gating model. No clear subset that might implement an inhibitory gate was observed. Together with previous evidence against upstream inhibitory mechanisms in premotor cortex, this provides evidence against an inhibitory “gate” for motor output in cortex. Instead, it appears that some other mechanism must likely exist.']",['Not applicable 1314'],[]

Thioredoxin 1 (Trx1) is a conserved antioxidant that functions as a classic disulfide reductase. It also catalyzes the transnitrosylation or denitrosylation of caspase 3 (Casp3), underscoring its central role in determining Casp3 nitrosylation specificity. However, the mechanisms that regulate Trx1 transnitrosylation and denitrosylation of specific targets are unresolved. Here we used an optimized mass spectrometric method to demonstrate that Trx1 is itself nitrosylated by ', '-nitrosoglutathione at Cys', ' only after the formation of a Cys', '-Cys', ' disulfide bond upon which the disulfide reductase and denitrosylase activities of Trx1 are attenuated.

Overexpression of ', ' (a mutant Trx1 with both Cys', ' and Cys', ' replaced by serine to mimic the disulfide reductase-inactive Trx1) in HeLa cells promoted the nitrosylation of specific target proteins. Using a global proteomics approach, we identified 47 novel Trx1 transnitrosylation target protein candidates. From further bioinformatics analysis of this set of nitrosylated peptides, we identified consensus motifs that are likely to be the determinants of Trx1-mediated transnitrosylation specificity. Among these proteins, we confirmed that Trx1 directly transnitrosylates peroxiredoxin 1 at Cys', ' and Cys', ' and protects it from H', 'O', '-induced overoxidation. Functionally, we found that Cys', '-mediated Trx1 transnitrosylation of target proteins is important for protecting HeLa cells from apoptosis. These data demonstrate that the ability of Trx1 to transnitrosylate target proteins is regulated by a crucial stepwise oxidative and nitrosative modification of specific cysteines, suggesting that Trx1, as a master regulator of redox signaling, can modulate target proteins via alternating modalities of reduction and nitrosylation.']",['Not applicable 1317'],[]

We have identified 7SK RNA to be enriched in nuclear speckles or interchromatin granule clusters (IGCs), a subnuclear domain enriched in pre-mRNA processing factors. 7SK RNA, in association with HEXIM 1 and 2, is involved in the inhibition of transcriptional elongation by RNA polymerase II.
